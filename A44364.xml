            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have hear Collected and brought together that which hath been ſcattered in divers great Vollums, writ by ſeveral Authors, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe my Labours may prove more profitable to ſuch who have a deſire to be informed in theſe things; thoſe great Books being too Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous, and coſtly for the generality to read or buy; I have therefore for the ſake of ſuch who have but little leiſure, and cannot read much, brought the Hiſtory of theſe things into a nearer compaſs, that ſo the meaneſt capacity may eaſily comprehend the Lords dealings with the Sons of men in all Generations; and my chief aim in this work, is, for the good and information of all People, that they may ſee how the Lord preſerved his Church in all times, and what great things he hath done for them, who led the Ancient Fathers, Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles by his mighty Power, in which they ſerved and worſhipped him, whereby they left a ſweet Savour behind them, as the Reader may ſee at large in the enſuing Treatiſe, which containeth a Cloud of Witneſſes to the Lords Work, and Power. And though theſe Teſtimonies may be ſlighted and diſ-eſteemed by the ſenſual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from below; yet I know it will be acceptable, and a confirming and ſtrengthening to the Faith of ſome who are Innocent and Upright to the Lord, and have a delight in reading and meditating upon his Wayes, and of his tender dealings with his Church and People, who in all Ages preſerved his little Remnant whom he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up as righteous Branches to bring forth Fruits of Holineſs in the middeſt of a perverſe Generation: And on the other hand the Reader many ſee, in this enſuing Tract, Satan's cruelty, the great Enemy to mans good, who hath in all Ages uſed all his Power to ſtop the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and growth of this holy <hi>Seed,</hi> by Perſecuting, Murdering and Deſtroying their Bodies, and uſing his utmoſt indeavours by Cruelties to ſtop the leaſt good Inclination that might at any time ſtir in any; and this hath been the work of the Evil one ever ſince he got footing in mens hearts, he hath alwayes ſought to extinguiſh the <hi>Work of God,</hi> and hath deceived Nations, and all the World wondered after the Beaſt; and <hi>John</hi> in his time ſaw a Terrible Day was to come on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth, for the Devil was come down having, great Wrath; and when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſt into the Earth he Perſecuted the Woman, which brought forth the Man Child &amp; the Woman fled into the Wilderneſs for a time and times and half a time, and the Earth helped the Woman, and the Earth opened her Mouth
<pb facs="tcp:39043:3"/>and ſwollowed up the Flood, which the Dragon caſt out of his Mouth; and the Dragon was Wrath with the Woman, and went to make War with the Remnant of her <hi>Seed,</hi> which kept the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimonies of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but they overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Teſtimony; and the Lord ſtill preſerv'd a Remnant that bow'd not their knees to <hi>Baal:</hi> And the Lord ſaid, David <hi>ſhall never want'a man to ſit upon the Thrown of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael; and this hath been fulfilled in that the Lord hath from time to time raiſed up his Living Witneſſes, both to teſtifie to, and ſuffer for his Name and Truth, as will appear in this Book, to which I refer the Reader for ſatisfaction, and remain a Lover of all the Upright in Heart,</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough the Sufferings of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were very great after the death of the Apoſtles, for ſome time, and it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but there was a ſincerity in ſome of the <hi>Chriſtian Churches;</hi> yet as <hi>John</hi> teſtified in his day, he ſaw the true Church flee into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Apoſtle foretold,<note place="margin">2.

So it was not long after the Apoſtles time before theſe Propheſies were fulfiled; for if the Reader peruſeth this following Diſcourſe, he will find a great Decay, and Apoſtacy from that Life and Power that the Apoſtles were in, and the corrupt Fruits of many of theſe called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> brought forth, manifeſted the great Degeneration that was come upon the Chriſtian Church; for as <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. Chap 6.</note> when Perſecution at any time ceaſed then began Hereſie to ſpring apace among the Chriſtians, until at laſt there was continual Diſcord and Contention, and they broke out into Sects and Opinions, and perſecuted one another about their ſeveral Forms of Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo far degenerated from the Doctrine of Chriſt which taught to Love Enemies, that they became <hi>haters of one another,</hi> and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World, that they had loſt the <hi>bleſſed Love and unity</hi> that was amongſt the Apoſtles and Brethren of the Chriſtian Church in the beginning; but before a perticular Account be given of that, its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the Reader underſtand that the Eſtate of the Chriſtians in the firſt Times after the Apoſtles, was their moſt ſuffering Times, when as yet the Chriſtian Religion was accounted by the Heathen but an upſtart thing, and therefore they preſecuted them greatly, as may be ſeen at large in the Teſtimony of the Martyrs hereunto annexed.</p>
                  <p>But through the tenderneſs of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Cap. 13. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </note> the Chriſtians had ſome intermiſſion from their Sufferings, and they began to be in ſome requeſt; for after <hi>Adrians</hi> death, <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> ſucceeding, he continued that peace with the Chriſtians he found begun in <hi>Adrians</hi> laſt dayes, for which he had the name of <hi>Pius;</hi> yet by the peoples tumult, without the Emperours conſent, ſome were martyred: To this Emperour, <hi>Juſtin</hi> made an Apology on the behalf of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

                  <p>This King <hi>John</hi> was ſhortly after (as it is Recorded) poyſoned by one <hi>Simon</hi> a Monk, who being abſolved of his Abbot before hand, for doing this fact; to accomptiſh his Deſign, he finds a Toad in the Garden, and pricks him with a Pen-Knife until he had made him vomit up all his Poyſon, which he having conveyed into a Cup of Wine, began to the King with a ſmiling countinance, ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>If it ſhall pleaſe your Princely Majeſty, here is ſuch a Cup of Wine, as you never drank a better; I turſt this Waſſel ſhall make all</hi> England <hi>glad:</hi> The King having drunk, and anon being ill, enquired for <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Monk, to whom ſome anſwered, that he was departed this life (for his Guts guſhed out of his Belly) the King replyed, then God have mercy on my Soul, and ſo he dyed, much repenting of his former life.</p>
                  <p>About this time ſeveral perſons were ſtirred up by the Lord to declare againſt the Pope, as an Heretick, and were by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for their pains, viz. <hi>Arnoldus, Johannes, Semeca, Gulielmus de Santo amorie, Gallus,</hi> and <hi>Groſthead,</hi> great Writers againſt the Popes Decrees, giving many ſigns of falſe Teachers; of whom ſee more in my Teſtimonies of the Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>The Pope being at odds with the Emperor <hi>Fredrick</hi> the ſecond, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">years since Christ </seg>1248</label> would not at any hand be reconciled, though the King of <hi>France</hi> ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly interceed, and the Emperor himſelf cleared himſelf of all imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and offered full ſaitsfaction for all pretended wrongs, and to go out of his Empire (if the Pope would not endure him there) to the holy Land, never to return into <hi>Europe</hi> again, ſo as his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> Nephew to King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> might ſucceed him, with offer of other moſt reaſonable conditions: Theſe Oppoſitions of the Pope againſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperours and Kings, gave the <hi>Turks</hi> great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of prevailing againſt thoſe called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the grand Cauſe that God did not proſper the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their wars in the holy-Land was imputed to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> adhering to their Maſſes and other Superſtitions.</p>
                  <p>And thus having given a brief Relation of the moſt material Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Affairs of the pretended <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> till this time; I ſhall now Proceed to give a Diſcovery of the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>Monks, Fryars</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who now began to ſwarm in the Apoſtized Church of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read that many Religious men heretofore contemning the World, and all the Pomp, Pride and Vanity thereof, withdrew themſelves into the Wilderneſs, and Deſart places, in <hi>Syria, Aegypt,</hi> and other Countries, it being in the time of great Perſecution, to the end they might the better (being not troubled in the worldly cares and incumbrance) beſtow their time in reading the Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39043:35"/>Praying, Meditating and ſuch divine <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> whereof <hi>Paul,</hi> ſirnamed the firſt Hermit, <hi>Anthony, Hilarion, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> were the firſt and chiefeſt among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who for their Sanctity of Life were in thoſe dayes had in great Honour; for then this kind of life was ſimple and free, and not Bound or Tyed to Unlawful Vows and Ridiculous Ceremonies, as afterwards came to be obſerved by ſuch as were called Monks and Fryars; their Habit was then homely, and yet decent, as every man beſt pleaſed to wear, neither were they bound to abide or remain in any one particular place, nor tyed to one kind of life by Vow, but free to ſtay there where they liked beſt, or to go into any City or Country where they would, at their own pleaſure; they ſought out the moſt Deſart place as they could find, that is in the Wilderneſs, working with their hands, and getting their living with the ſweat of their Brows, gave a ſingular good <hi>Example</hi> to all men to live <hi>Virtuouſly</hi> and <hi>Godly,</hi> inſtructing their Families, and others that reſorted unto them, to lead a godly and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Life; and were admired and honoured of all good men for their Doctrine, Integrity of Life, and godly zeal; for as yet (ſaith the Hiſtory) the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had but one Law, and one Religion, which afterwards fell out otherwiſe, to the Grief and Sorrow of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right among them, to ſee what Rents and Diviſions, Sects and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Superſtitions and Ceremonies were brought in amongſt them, although good ſtirrings there might be amongſt theſe that lived this private life.</p>
                  <p>Their Succeſſors and Imitators were far unlike them, for the words of <hi>Philo,</hi> cited by <hi>Euſebius</hi> are theſe, <hi>Now let our Monks,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who live like Kings, who ſwim in all manner of delights and pleaſures, who affect nothing more then Promotion and Honour, and whoſe chiefeſt care and ſtuddy is to gather Wealth and to hoord up Gold, Silver,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>About this time ſeveral Sects of Monks began to ſpread forth out of the Order of <hi>Benedictus;</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">years since Christ </seg>562</label> their Habit was to wear a black looſe Coat of Stuff, reaching down to their heels, with a Cowle or Hood to cover their bald Pates, which hangs down to their Shoulders, and under that Coat another white Habit as large as the former; they ſhave the hairs off their heads, except one little round Circle, which they leave round about their heads, which they call <hi>Corona;</hi> they are bound to abſtain from Fleſh, unleſs it be when they are ſick: Theſe <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks would have the World believe, that they are godly and religious men, and would not be ranked with the Jeſuites, who were States men, for they (poor Monks) meddle not with matters of State, or with Kings Affairs; but for all their counterfeit holineſs, an <hi>Engliſh Benedictine</hi> Monk of <hi>Swinſted Abby,</hi> Poyſoned King <hi>John,</hi> as is before related, for the which fact he was &amp; ſtill is highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all <hi>Papiſt</hi> in general; and one ſaith on him thus, <hi>Regem perimere Meritorium ratus eſt,</hi> he thought it a meritorious deed for to kill the King.</p>
                  <p>About this time began to peep out another Sect of Monks, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The <hi>Bethlemite</hi> Fryars began 1257. their firſt dwelling was at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>

Pope <hi>Pius</hi> commanded theſe Fryars to wear a Sky-coloured Habit, but now this Order wears a Croſs of red Cloath or Scarlet
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39043:36"/>fixed to their Habit on their Breaſt, and wear black; theſe Fryars do likewiſe live by their Lands and Revenues, they had a Monaſtery heretofore at <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> which is now put to a better uſe, being built up into Tenements.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bridget</hi> of <hi>Sweethland</hi> being a Widdow did inſtitute an Order of Fryars and Nuns, and coming her ſelf to <hi>Rome,</hi>

                  <p>The next is the <hi>Minorite</hi> Fryars, they wear a moriſh-coloured Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and never eat Fleſh, Butter or Cheeſe, but feed on the beſt Fiſh and Oyle, the fineſt Bread, and pureſt Wine, the beſt Spices, Fruit, Herbs and Roots that they can buy for their Money; they had a Cloiſter built for them at <hi>Barkhamſted</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1257.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mendicant</hi> or Begging Fryars do wear a long white Coat of Cloath down to their heels, all looſe, with a Cowle or Hood, of the ſame, when they are in their Cloiſters, but when they go abroad, they wear another black Coat over the other, with another Cowle; both their Coats are then bound cloſe to their Bodies, with a broad leather Girdle or Belt, which Girdle is a very holy thing (if they may be believed) for they call it Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> Girdle, and many Lame people do wear it for pure devotion ſake, looking upon it to have ſome ſingular Virtue in it; this leather Belt is given to none but thoſe that are ſpecial good Benefactors, and ſuch as pay dearly for it, which brings them in no ſmall benefit.</p>
                  <p>The next is the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryars, their firſt appearance in the <hi>word</hi> was in the year 1270. that is, Fryars of the Order of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of Mount <hi>Carmel;</hi> at firſt they were ordained to wear a party-coloured Habit, white and red, made in the form of a man, the which they then dreamed to be like unto that which <hi>Elias</hi> did uſe to wear; but afterwards Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> forbid them to wear that Habit,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39043:37"/>as being not well befitting their Profeſſion, and therefore a black long habit and a Cowle was given them, and over that a long white Robe or Cloak, as beſt agreeing with Virginity.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort is the <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> or <hi>Gray Fryars,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, They would not touch any Money, and made a ſhow, as if they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from all Fleſh, and did eat nothing but raw Herbs and Roots, and did wear Wooden Clogs inſtead of Shoes, railing againſt other Fryars, who Poſſeſſed Money, and eat Meat, wore Shoes and Stokings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe did not long perſevere in this Auſtere life, but their delight was to fare delitiouſly, and to cram their Guts with the beſt Dainties.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſort of theſe <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> called <hi>Penitentiarian,</hi> theſe wear no Linnen, as they ſay, neither Doublet, Breeches nor Hoſe, but only a little pair of Linnen Drawers to ſave their skin from their courſe habit; inſtead of Shoes, they wear wooden Clogs, which are under their Feet, bound over with Leather Straps, their habit is made of a very courſe Cloath, and cloſe before, reaching down to their heels, with a Cowle cloſe to their head made of the ſame, and alſo a gray Rope made of hair, full of knots, inſtead of a Girdle about their Loynes; they never ride, but go a foot; when they travel they have a great pair of wooden Beads, with a wooden Croſs tyed to their Girdles before them: If theſe <hi>Franciſcan Fryars</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, they ſay, All that they wear about them is holy; yea, all that they eat, drink or touch, is Sanctified; their grecy <hi>Cowle, Habit, Sandals,</hi> and eſpecially their knotty <hi>Girdles,</hi> they ſay, hath many Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and therefore they have no ſmall profit from the Lay-people that they may wear them; concerning theſe Fryars Habits one wrote theſe Verſes as followeth;

                  </p>
                  <p>And truely many people are of Opinion at this day, that this Fire was transferred after his death unto his Society, ſeeing they do perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate ſo much of it, for out of the fervour of their Mercenary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they have ever ſince exerciſed the Trade of Incendiaries in all places, and they have ſet all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> on Fire; neither is there any Kingdom, Common-wealth, City or Province, which they have not inflamed with Wars, Seditions and Perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>And now further the Reader may ſee what ignorance was among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this time, for the Heathen People heretofore had many Gods, and every one of them their diſtinct Office, as <hi>Apollo</hi> was the God of Wiſdom; <hi>Mars</hi> of Wars; <hi>Aeolus</hi> of the <hi>winds; Neptune</hi> of the Seas, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>But how the Monks, Fryars and Prieſt, did take this, I cannot till, for that it clipped away ſome of their profit; for they had often money and gifts to ſay Maſſes for Womens ſafe delivery, eſpecially, the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Fryers of <hi>Burgos</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> who ſold the meaſure of their Crucifix at a dear rate, becauſe they counted it a precious Relique for many Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Jeſuits are great Intelligencers and States-men in moſt parts of the World, and whereſoever they remain they take upon them to teach and inſtruct Children, as well of Noble-men, as alſo of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior perſons, profeſſing to do the ſame freely, and without reward, wherein they deal ſo carefully, that the Parents do not account their Childrens time Miſpent, but alſo do reward them highly, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39043:38"/>the Jeſuits make thereof a double benefit; for, firſt, they bind the Parents of the Children thereby to be their Favourites; ſecondly, as for the Schollers, they ſtrick into their tender Capacity, ſuch a reverence of themſelves, and do withall diſtil into their minds (E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially into ſuch as are witty) ſuch Points of Doctrine, and ſuch an Opinion of their Holineſs and integrity, that the ſame very ſeldom, and ſometimes never weareth away, but rather increaſeth with their years, according to that ſaying.
<q>Quo ſemet eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odorem Teſta diu.</q> That is, <hi>The Veſſel will long retain the taſte of the firſt Liquor it firſt held or contained,</hi> which is undoubtedly of no ſmall moment to the ſtrengthening and upholding of their Faction and Society; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they have ſo cunningly wrought, that whereſoever they are, they only are the general hearers of all Confeſſions, diving thereby into the ſecrets and drifts of all men, acquainting themſelves with their humors and Imperfections, and making, as time and occaſion ſerves, uſe and benefit thereof to themſelves.</p>

                  <p>AFter the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were once the People of God, and had the Laws, Statutes, Ordinances and Commands of God made known to them, as is before related, had apoſtatized from the holy Spirit or Life, they provoked God, and ſoon forgat him, &amp; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully entreated and killed the Servants and Meſſengers of God, yet the Lord had Compaſſion to mankind, and remembred his Promiſe, and in love to the World ſent forth his Son, who ſaid when he was come, he was the <hi>true Light that enlighteneth every one that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi> yet the world knew him not, but God ſent his Meſſenger to prepare his Way, and the Voice of one cryed in the Wilderneſs, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the Way of the Lord, and make ſtrait Paths for our God;</hi> and when this Meſſenger, whoſe name was <hi>John,</hi> was come, the hand of the Lord was with him, and he preached repentance for the remiſſion of ſins; and for reproving <hi>Herod</hi> of his Evils, he was ſhut up in Priſon; and though Chriſt teſtified of him, <hi>that among thoſe that were born of women, there was not a greater Prophet then John:</hi> Yet this <hi>Herod,</hi> who had married <hi>Herodias,</hi> his brothers wife, to whom <hi>John</hi> ſaid, it is not lawfull for thee to have thy brothers wife;<note place="margin">John Baptiſt <hi>beheaded.</hi>
                     </note> therefore the perſecuting ſpirit aroſe in <hi>Herodias,</hi> and ſhe would have killed him, but could not; yet afterwards ſhe was the cauſe of <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> being beheaded in Priſon.</p>

And thence forth, when any Queſtion was propoſed to her, her anſwer was, I am the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt; her Kindred and Friends earneſtly ſolliciting her to change her mind, but ſhe conſtantly refuſed, with deteſtation of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Then did the cruel Judge condemn her to be burnt, which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhe embraced joyfully, as a thing moſt ſweet and delectable; and ſo ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to the Flames, in countenance, jeſture and words declaring the Joy of her Heart, coupled with ſingular conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſo embracing the Fire ſhe ſweetly ſlept in the Lord.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Groſthead</hi> living in the year 1240 wrot ſharply to the Pope, (eſpecially for the evils he committed in <hi>England</hi>) that he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Chriſt, a Murderer of Souls and an Heretick, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his death-bed of the corruptions which were ſprung up in the Church, and inveighed bitterly againſt the manifold abominations of the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying, well may theſe verſes be applied to them.</p>

                     <l>The whole World cannot ſuffice their greedy covetous mind,</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>For his thundring againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and for his publick reproving of the covetouſneſs, pride and manifold Tyrannies of the Pope he was excommunicated to the pit of Hell by <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, and cited to come to his bloody Court; but he appealed from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39043:49"/>Popes Tyranny to the Eternal Tribunal of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhortly after died: Yea, before this there were ſome found in <hi>England</hi> who teſtified againſt the corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuffered for the ſame, for in the year 884. <hi>John Patrick Erigena</hi> wrot a Book about the Lords Supper, which was afterwards condemned by the Pope, and he martyred for it.</p>

                  <p>About this time began the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth King of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe reign great alterations and turns of Religion were wrought by the mighty operation of Gods Hand, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuch as had not been ſeen (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much groaned for) many hundred years before; nevertheleſs, many ſuffered great Perſecutions and Martyrdom in this Kings reign, both in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere, and many good men were raiſed up to bear witneſs to the Truth, yet ſome were of opinion, that it was not wholy the Kings fault that ſo much Blood was ſpilt in his time, for the Biſhops were the <hi>Draco</hi> to make the bloody Laws, and it was the Biſhops that were earneſt to ſee the Laws put in Execution, the King oftentimes ſcarce knowing what was done; and but hearing of a Woman that was the ſecond time put upon the Rack, exceedingly condemned the party that was the cauſe of it, for uſing ſuch extreme Cruelty.</p>

And accordingly when they came to Land, the Prieſt taking two others with him that were preſent in the Boat, went and complained to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Warham,</hi> who ſent a Warrant preſently to apprehend <hi>Brown;</hi> and being apprehended the Meſſenger bound his feet under his horſe belly, and carried him away to the Arch-Biſhop, neither his wife nor friends knowing whether he went, nor what they would do with him.

                  <p>This oppoſition made by <hi>Luther</hi> much troubled the Pope, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing the Followers of <hi>Luther</hi> to encreaſe, and therefore he earneſtly deſired ſome ſpeedy Remedy againſt the ſame, and to that end ſent to the <hi>German</hi> Princes to move them thereunto; but the <hi>German</hi> Princes, inſtead of putting the Apoſtolick ſentence in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers, exhibited at the Councel of <hi>Norenberge</hi> 100 Grievances and Oppreſſions againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as forbidding Marriage to ſome, forbidding Meats, times of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages reſtrained, and after releaſed again for money, ſelling remiſſion of ſins for money, the licentious Life of the Prieſts, and their great number of Holy dayes, and ſuch like other things, which would be too much to Mention.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Deputies brought a Copy of the Arreſt Decree and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings unto the Kings Lieutenant, declaring unto him the great Injuries, Polling, Extortions, Exactions, Tyrannies and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Judges, as well Secular as Eccleſiaſtical, had uſed againſt them of <hi>Merindol</hi> and others, as touching the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and diſpoſition of thoſe which were perſecuted, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that the moſt part of the men of <hi>Province,</hi> affirmed them to be men given to great Labour and Travel, and that about two hundred years paſt (as it is reported) they came out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                     <p>Notwithſtanding this Letter was writ in favour unto the people of <hi>Merindol,</hi> yet the Biſhop of <hi>Cavaillon</hi> took advantage at one part of the Letter to proſecute his Malice againſt the people of <hi>Merindol</hi> for upon the Kings Letter the Parliament ordained, that <hi>John Durand</hi> Counceller of the Parliament, with the Secretary, and the Biſhop of <hi>Cavaillon,</hi> with a Doctor of Divinity ſhould go to <hi>Merindol,</hi> and there declare to the Inhabitants the Errors and Hereſies which they knew to be contained in their confeſſion of their Faith, and make them apparent by good and ſufficient Information, and having ſo convicted them by the Word of God, they ſhould make them to renounce and abjure the ſaid Hereſies, and if they did refuſe to abjure, then to make report thereof, that the Court might appoint how to proceed againſt them; the Biſhop of <hi>Cavaillon</hi> would not tarry till the time appointed by the Court for the Execution of this Matter, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Doctor went to <hi>Merindol</hi> to make them abjure, but they refuſing he grew very angry with them.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after <hi>John Durandus</hi> Councellor of the Parliament, went to execute the Commiſſion, according to order, to whom the Bailiff of <hi>Merindal</hi> ſaid, it ſeemeth unto me that there is no due form of Proceſs in this Judgment, for there is no party here, that doth accuſe us; if we had any Accuſer preſent, which according to the rule of the Scripture, either ſhould prove by good demonſtration out of the New and Old Teſtament, that whereof we are accuſed, or if he were

It is unexpreſſible how Lamentably and Cruelly theſe poor People were Perſecuted, inſomuch that no kind of Cruelty and Tyranny was left unpractiſed; for them that eſcaped into the Woods and Mountains, being taken, were either ſlain out-right, or put in the Gally and made Slaves; ſome were famiſhed in Rocks and Caves with Hunger; and thus it continued till God by his juſt Judgments cut off the bloody Tyrant <hi>Miniers</hi> by death.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Cromwell</hi> was through the goodneſs of God raiſed up to be a friend and a favourer of thoſe that profeſt the Goſpel, who though but a Smiths Son, born at <hi>Putney,</hi> for the pregnancy of his wit, he was firſt entertained by Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> and by him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in many great Affairs; the Cardinal falling, the King took him unto his Service, and finding his great Abillities, advanced him for his worth to great places of Honour and Truſt, through whoſe perſwaſions ſeveral Injunctions were put out by the King for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Religion; and he was the great Inſtrument in overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abbies, Monaſteries and Friaries, which were a little before by Act of Parliament given into the Kings hands: Whereupon, not only their Houſes were raſed, but their Poſſeſſions were divided amongſt the Nobility, inſomuch that all Friars, Monks, Cannons, Nuns, and other ſuch Sects, were ſo rooted out of this Land from the Foundation, that there ſeemed to be no room left for ſuch Weeds to grow here any more.</p>
                     <p>But as this <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> was raiſed up for good, and being ſo greatly in favour with the King, uſed all means he could to perſwade him to reform the enormities in the Church; on the other hand, Satan raiſed up his Inſtrument, which was <hi>Stephen Gardner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who uſed all wilds and ſubtill means he could to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King againſt the ſame, caſting upon the Profeſſors of Truth the name of Hereticks, Sectaries, Anabaptiſts, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, and ſo far prevailed with the King, that by the Kings Authority certain Injunctions were publiſhed prohibiting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing any Books in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> written by the Sectaries and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, under the pain of the forfeiture of all their goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and their Bodies to be Impriſoned during the Kings pleaſure: And further, this <hi>Stephen Gardner</hi> inſtigated the King, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen (who was a favourer of Religion and Reformation)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:39043:70"/>but alſo againſt this <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who no doubt had brought the encreaſe of true Religion, according to his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to more prefection, had not this <hi>Gardner,</hi> and other Malignant Oppoſers thereof ſet themſelves againſt it, to hinder the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof: but now through the ſaid <hi>Gardners</hi> evill adviſe, the King, who before had raiſed the ſaid <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> for his worth and integrity, now for his pleaſure took him off, and ſuffered him to be Beheaded: After his death Religion, and the Reformation more and more decayed, whereby the Reader may ſee how variable the State of things ſtood in reference to Religion at this time, and with what difficulty any thing of Light and Truth came forth, how often things changed, even as the King was ruled and gave ear; ſometimes it went a little forward, and then backward again, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the perſons prevailed that were about the King.</p>
                     <p>And now the King being led through <hi>Gardners</hi> ſuggeſtions, began to withdraw ſhewing any favour to the Reformation in Religion, concluding ſo to do was moſt for his ſafety both at home and abroad, having ſo much diſpleaſed the Pope, and other Popiſh Princes, in what he had already done; and though he had rejected the Popes Authority, he would declare himſelf nevertheleſs to be a good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Son of the Mother Church, and a withſtander of new Hereſies; and then calling a new Parliament, and Convocation of Prelates, there was <hi>ſix Articles</hi> decreed concerning Religion, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commonly called <hi>a whip with ſix Srings,</hi> it was pretended for the Unity of the Church, but what Unity followed, the groaning hearts of many that ſuffered death by the ſame, both in this Kings time, and in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, may declare.</p>

                     <p>The day being come, the King aſcended his Throne, clothed all in white, he lookt upon the Priſoner with a ſterne Countenance, as if his mind was full of Indignation, and then called forth the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and commanded him to declare to the People the Cauſes of that Aſſembly, the Subſtance of the Biſhops Speech tended to this, That the King would have none to conceive, that whereas the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Name of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> being utterly aboliſhed, he would alſo extinguiſh all Religion, or give Liberty to Hereticks to trouble the Churches of <hi>England</hi> without puniſhment; the Biſhop having ended his Speech, the chief thing that the King preſt <hi>Lambort</hi> to declare, was, what Opinion he held touching the Sacrament of the Altar; to which he anſwered fully, and the Diſpute held chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that point for ſome hours until the King and Biſhops, enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt him, forced him to ſilence at laſt.</p>
                     <p>The King being minded to end the Diſpute, ſaid to <hi>Lambort,</hi> What ſayeſt thou after all theſe Labours and Reaſons of theſe learned Men? Art thou yet ſatisfied? Wilt thou live or die; thou haſt yet free choice?</p>

                     <p>Shortly after ſhe was ſent from <hi>Newgate</hi> to the ſign of the Crown, where, ſhe ſaid, one <hi>Rich</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> uſed all their power by flattering words, to perſwade her from God, but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not with her; one <hi>Nicholas Shaxton</hi> counſelled her to recant, as he had done; ſhe told him, it had been good for him he had never been born; then <hi>Rich</hi> ſent her to the Tower to be racked, where firſt he and one of the Councel examined her, telling of her, that the King was informed, that if ſhe would, ſhe could name a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her Sect; ſhe anſwered, that the King was as well deceived in that, as he was in other Matters.</p>

                     <p>The Prayer of <hi>Anne Askew</hi> before her Death.</p>
                     <q>O Lord, I have more Enemies now, then there be Hairs on my Head, yet, Lord, let them never overcome me with vain words; but fight thou, Lord, in my ſtead, for on thee caſt I my Care; with all the ſpite they can imagine they fall upon me, which am thy poor Creature; yet, Lord, let me not ſet by them which are againſt me, for in thee is my whole delight; and Lord, I heartily deſire of thee, that thou wilt of thy moſt merciful Goodneſs forgive them that Violence which they do, and have done unto me; open alſo thou their blind Hearts, that they may hereafter do that thing in thy Sight which is only acceptable before thee, and to ſet forth thy Truth aright, without all vain Fantaſie of ſinful men: So be it, O Lord, ſo be it.</q>
                     <p>The day of her Execution being appointed, ſhe was brought into <hi>Smithfield</hi> in a Chair, becauſe ſhe could not go on her feet by means of her great Torments; when ſhe was brought to the ſtake, ſhe was tied by the middle with a Chain that held up her Body; and ſo encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with the Flames of Fire, as a bleſſed Sacrifice unto God, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up her life, in the Year 1546. leaving behind her a ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſtian-Conſtancy, for all men to follow; there was at the ſame time three others burnt with her in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the death of this Woman, the Poniſh Clergy conſulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how they might further proceed to keep the Truth under and down, and to that end obtained another Proclamation, in the Kings name, for the aboliſhing the Scriptures in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and all other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Books, which might give any light to the People, which made
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39043:74"/>ſore work and cauſed Perſecution for a time, but it was not long that it continued by reaſon of the Kings death, which was ſhortly after.</p>
                     <p>But before there be a full Concluſion of the Tranſactions in this Kings reign, its neceſſary a ſhort Account be given of the riſe and fall of <hi>Thom is Cromwel;</hi> of whom mention is made before; eſpecially, ſeeing he was a man ſo Zealous for Reformation of both Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>He was born at <hi>Putney,</hi> his Father being a Smith, as is before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in his youthful dayes, it is ſaid, he had little regard to God and Religion, but travelled beyond Seas, and for a time was there a Souldier; at length getting the New Teſtament in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by often reading in it he began to be touched, and ſomething opened in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and coming into <hi>England</hi> again, Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him in his ſervice, where, after ſome yoars remaining, he was preferred to be Solicitor to the Cardinal. After the fall of Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> he was by the Maſter of the Roles preferred to the King (who had then to do againſt the Pope) as a fit perſon to be imployed by him, and being brought to the King at his Garden in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he poſſeſſed the King that his Authority was abuſed by the Clergy, and by being ſworn to the Pope they had run themſelves into a <hi>Premunire,</hi> and that now the King had an Opertunity to inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: To this the King gave ear, and liked well his advice, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into his ſervice, and ſent him to the Convocation-houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Biſhops, where he made a Speech to this effect, that in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they had ſworn to the Pope, contrary to their Fealty due to the King, they had forfeited all their Goods, Chattels, Lands, Poſſeſſions to the King, &amp;c. This amazed the Biſhops at firſt, but after a little pauſe, they began to ſhrink, and before they could be quit of the <hi>Premunire,</hi> by Act of Parliament it coſt them to the King no leſs then One hundred eighteen thouſand eight hundred and forty pounds.</p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Cromwel</hi> grew greatly in favour with the King, and was made one of his Privy Council, and Maſter of the Rolls, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Knight of the Garter, and Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and now being come into ſuch Authority, and ſeeing the Superſtition, Blindneſs Hypocriſie and Idolatry of the Monks, and Fryars, and Papiſts, whoſe filthy ſtink did breath up a moſt peſtiferous fume, as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> ſaid in the like caſe of <hi>Rome:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Cromwel,</hi> like a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, was raiſed up to root them up, which while the King favoured him, he proſecuted with effect, as before is related; but when the Popiſh Biſhops ſaw the Popes power aboliſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> they never gave over uſing all their uttmoſt Endeavours, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Contrivances, till they had laid a Plaiſter to his Wounded Head.</p>
                     <p>It would be too long to recite what benefit this <hi>Cromwel</hi> by his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Zeal wrought in a little time for the publick good, what good Orders he eſtabliſhed, what Wickedneſs and Vices he ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39043:74"/>what Corruptions he reformed, what Abuſes he brought to light, and Popiſh Idolatry and Images he ſuppreſſed, (One called, <hi>The Rood of Grace</hi>) wherein a man ſtood incloſed with a hundred Wyres within the <hi>Rood,</hi> to make the Image goggle its Eyes, nod its Head, hang the Lip, and move and ſhake his Jaws, according to the value of the Gift offered; if it were a ſmall piece of Silver, then would he hang a frowning Lip, if it were a piece of Gold, then ſhould his Jaws go Merrily: Thus were poor peoples Souls ſeduced, and their pockets pickt by theſe Idolatrous Forgers, until <hi>Cromwel</hi> cauſed the ſaid Image to be carried publickly to <hi>Pauls,</hi> where the People tore it in pieces.</p>
                     <p>He was a man not only Zealous for the publick Reformation, but alſo always ready to help private perſons that were in diſtreſs; and though its common amongſt men that are raiſed from low eſtate to great place and outward preferment; to forget themſelves what they formerly were, and the perſons from whom they received benefits; It was not ſo with him, for in his Travels beyond Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to a low condition, and being relieved by a Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in <hi>Florence,</hi> and entertained in his Houſe, when he was in great diſtreſs, and when he was minded to return to <hi>England,</hi> the Merchant gave him a Horſe, Money and Apparel, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great thankfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>This Merchant not long after (through great loſſes fell to decay; and having money owing him in <hi>England,</hi> came over to ſee if he could get it, and arriving at <hi>London,</hi> not thinking of the kindneſs he had ſhewed to <hi>Cromwel;</hi> but as he was travelling the Streets, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as he was riding along eſpied him, and knew him, and alighted, and took notice of him, and of his former kindneſs, and invited him to Court, who coming there, after he had dined with him, he had the Merchant into a private Room, and paid him fully for all he had of him at <hi>Florence,</hi> and gave him ſufficiently over, as a Recompence for his kindneſs, and kept him in his Houſe all the time of his remaining in <hi>England.</hi> This is but one example of many that might be mentioned to ſhew this <hi>Cromwells</hi> Gratitude and Courteſie.</p>
                     <p>His care and Zeal for the ſetling the Proteſtant Religion was that which brought him to his end, for that, for the better eſtaliſhing thereof he deviſed to effect a Marriage between the King and the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleeve,</hi> whoſe Siſter was Married to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> a Proteſtant Prince, by which Marriage, it was ſuppoſed, there would be eſtabliſhed a perpetuall Peace and Amity between this Kingdom and the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> which would much ſtrengthen the Proteſtant Party againſt the Tyranny and Oppreſſion of the Pope and his Adherents: But preſently after the Marriage, <hi>Stephen Gardner,</hi> who had ſoon after crept into favour with the King (as is before related) ſuggeſted to him ſome occaſions of diſtaſte againſt the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and ſome apprehenſions, of fear by reaſon of that Odium which he had pulled upon himſelf, by rejecting the Pope, and demoliſhing Abbies and Monaſteries,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39043:75"/>whereby (as he told him) he had made the Pope the Emperour, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> his Enemies; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own Subjects, who were much diſtaſted with the Innovations in Religion, and that the only way to heal all, was to ſhew himſelf Sharp and ſevere againſt the new Sectaries: This occaſioned the King to withdraw his favour from <hi>Cromwell;</hi> for being one day in the Council Chamber, he was ſuddainly apprehended and committed to the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> at the hearing whereof many good men were much troubled, the charge laid againſt him was, that he was a ſupporter of Hereticks, and a Spreader of their Books, and that he had cauſed to be tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sacrament of the Alter, and that he had ſpoke words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King; but whatever he was accuſed of, he was ſoon after condemned in the Tower, without coming to his Anſwer, and was beheaded; his death the King ſhortly after bewailed, wiſhing he had his <hi>Cromwel</hi> alive again; ſo that it appears it was more the malice of his Adverſary, that ſtirred up the King againſt him, then any real cauſe by him given or acted that might juſtly occaſion his death.</p>
                     <p>In this year viz. 1545. one <hi>John Athee</hi> was indicted by the Kings writ for ſpeaking certain words againſt the Sacrament; That he would not believe in the thing that the Knave Prieſt made, neither in that which <hi>Longs</hi> wife ſelleth, but only in God which is in Heaven; and when it was told him, that God through his Word could make it Fleſh and Blood, he anſwered, ſo he might if he would turn it into a Chickens leg.</p>

                     <p>The King growing ſickly and froward left off his accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of viſiting the Queen, and therefore ſhe took all opportunities to viſit him, and did earneſtly ſolicite him to be Zealous in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; <hi>Wincheſter</hi> being preſent at one time, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King not to be very well pleaſed with her; when ſhe was gone he maliciouſly endeavoured to ſtir up the Kings Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, poſſeſſing the King, <hi>That under his Favour, he with others of the Council, could in a ſhort time diſcloſe ſuch Treaſon cloaked with the vail of Hereſie, that his Majeſty ſhould eaſily perceive how dangerous it was to nouriſh ſuch a Serpent in his Boſſom;</hi> this ſo ſtirred up the King that he gave them leave to draw up Articles againſt her, and thus far they got their end; the next thing was, to ſuborn Witneſſes to betray and accuſe her, and to find out what Books ſhe had in her Cloſets that were forbidden by Law, and to ſearch her Cloſets, and to apprehend the Queen, and ſend her by Barge to the Tower. The King being made privy to this deviſe by <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Wriſly,</hi> he politickly ſeemed to approve it, that he might ſee how far the malice of the Biſhop would carry him; and thus the Day, Time and place for the Apprehending the Queen, and ſome about her was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of.</p>
                     <p>The King at this time lay at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and by reaſon of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper ſeldom ſtirred abroad, and the time approaching for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Queen; ſhe ſuſpected nothing of it, and therefore uſed after her accuſtomed manner, when ſhe came to the King, ſtill to deal with him about Religion, as formerly ſhe had done; but one night after ſhe had taken her Leave of him, the King imparted the whole deſign to Doctor <hi>VVendy,</hi> enjoyning him not to ſpake of it to any Creature; but by Providence theſe Articles drawn up againſt her, &amp; ſigned by the King fell from of the Boſom one of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and was immediately carried to the Queen, who reading the Articles, knowing the Kings hand was ſuppriſed with ſuch a ſudden fear, that ſhe made pitious Mean and Lamentation; The King hearing that ſhe was in peril of her Life, ſent his Phyſicians to her, and Doctor <hi>VVendy</hi> knowing the cauſe better then the other, began ſecretly to break with her about the Articles, tilling her, that he knew well of them, though he ſtood in danger of his Life by revealing of them, yet to quiet his Conſcience he could not but give her Warning of them, intreating her ſomewhat to conform her ſelf to the Kings mind, not doubting but that by her humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſhe ſhould find him favourable to her; ſhortly after the King hearing of her dangerous Condition went to her, to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe uttered her Greif, <hi>fearing,</hi> as ſhe ſaid, <hi>leſt he had taken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt</hi> her. Whereupon he like a loving Husband with ſweet and comfortable Words ſomewhat eaſed her perplexed Mind, ſo that ſhe began to recover; the King being departed ſhe cauſed all her Books which the Law was againſt to be conveyed away, and taking
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:39043:76"/>a fit ſeaſon in an Evening, ſhe went to viſit the King, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with ſome of his Bed-Chamber. When he ſaw her, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained her Courteouſly, and began to Commnue with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, ſeeming deſirous to be reſolved by the Queen of certain doubts which he propoſed to her; ſhe perceiving his drift, with mild and reverend Conutenance anſwered him thus. <hi>Your Majeſty knows right well, neither am I ignorant what weakneſs attends our Sex, and therefore we are inferiour and Subject to man, our Head, whence all our directions muſt pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The King after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture returned to the Queen, who perceiving him to be much chafed, with Sweet words endeavoured to qualifie his diſpleaſure, ſaying, <hi>that though ſhe knew not what might be the cauſe, he was Offended, but deſired him, if it were not hainous; that for her ſake he would paſs it by, Ah poor Soul,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>little doſt thou know how ill he deſerves this Grace at thy hands, on my word, Sweet Heart, he hath been towards thee an Arrant Knave, and ſo let him go.</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39043:77"/>by whom he was condemned and burned for a chief Heretick, and Teacher of Hereſie.</p>
                     <p>But, notwithſtanding their bloody Tyranny, the Knowledge of God did Wonderfully encreaſe in this Country, partly by reading, and partly by brotherly Conference, which in thoſe dangerous dayes were much uſed, to the Comfort of many, which ſo enraged the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party, that in the year 1538. there were burned in one Fire four Perſons.</p>
                     <p>The year after <hi>Jeremy Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Alexander Kenedy</hi> were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and brought before the Biſhop, the ſaid <hi>Jeremy</hi> being a man of a meek and quiet Nature; <hi>Alexander</hi> was a young man about eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, <hi>Alexander</hi> at firſt was faint, and would fain have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted, but when all place of Repentance was denyed him, the Spirit of God began to refreſh him, yea, the inward Comfort began to burſt forth as well in his Viſſage as in his words, and he cryed in prayer to God, <hi>Oh Eternall God, how Wounderful is thy Love and Mercy, who haſt made me to feel Heavenly Comfort, which takeſt, from me that ungodly fear, which before I was oppreſſed with; now I defie death; do with me what you pleaſe; I praiſe God I am ready.</hi> Then did they rail upon him and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who alſo ſaid unto them, This is your hour and power of darkneſs: Now ſit ye as Judges, and we ſtand wrongfully Accuſed, and more wrongfully to be Condemned; but the day will come when our Innocency will appear, and ye ſhall ſee your own blindneſs to your Everlaſting Confuſion: Go forward, &amp; fulfill the meaſure of your Iniquity. Shortly aft'r th'y were Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, &amp; as they went to Execution <hi>Jeremy</hi> comforted <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaying to him, Brother, fear not, greater is he that that is in us, then he that is in the World; the pain that we are to ſuffer is ſhort, and ſhall be light, but our Joy and Conſolation ſhall never have end: Let us therefore ſtrive to enter into our Maſter and Saviours Joy by the ſame Strait Way which he hath taken before us; Death cannot hurt us, for it is already deſtroyed by him, for whoſe Sake we now Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. And thus they conſtantly continued ſtedfaſt in the Flaming Fire till they finiſhed their Courſe by Death.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1543. <hi>George Wiſeheart</hi> a man of a Courteous, Modeſt and Temperate Behaviour, fearing God and hating Covetouſneſs, very charitable and moderate in his Apparel and Diet, and for his Innocency was a man well beloved; he was accuſed on ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles by the Biſhops, and afterwards Condemned by them as an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick to be burnt; when he came to the fire he ſaid, <hi>Father of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I commend my Spirit into thy holy Hands;</hi> and then turned him to the People, and ſaid theſe Words, I beſeech you <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brethren and Siſters, that you be not offended in the Word of God for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Torments which you ſee already prepared for me; but I Exhort you, that you Love the Word of God, and ſuffer patiently, and with a comfortable heart for the Words ſake, which is your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Salvation and Everlaſting Comfort.</p>

                     <p>Then he prayed for them which accuſed him, ſaying, I beſeech thee, Father of Heaven, to forgive them that have through Ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or an evil Mind, forged Lyes againſt me; I forgive them with all my heart, and I beſeech Chriſt to forgive them who have Condemned me to death this day ignorantly.

                        <hi>Dear Friends, the Cauſe why I ſuffer this day, is not for any Crime laid to my Charge, but only for the defence of the Faith of Chriſt Jeſus, for which, as the faithful Martyrs have heretofore gladly offered themſelves, being aſſured, after the Death of their Bodies, of Eternal Felicity; ſo this day I praiſe God, that he hath called me of his Mercy, among the reſt of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to ſeal his Truth with my Life; which as I received it of him, ſo willingly I offer it to his Glory: Therefore as you will eſcape the eternal death, be no more ſeduced by the Lyes of Prieſts, Monks and Biſhops, and the reſt of the Sect of Antichriſt, but depend only upon Jeſus Chriſt, and his Mercy, that you may be delivered from Condemnation.</hi>

                     <p>As touching his Education he was born in <hi>Eſſex</hi> of an honeſt ſtock, and bred up a Courtier, his Perſon and Stature very comly, and his mind endued with excellent qualities, a man of a gentle behaviour, and of a fervent love to true Religion and godlineſs; he was alſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly adorned with valour and courage, whoſe Example therein was a good preſident to the reſt of his Brethren; and as it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, few men ſtood more notably, or triumphed more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly then this young man; for he was ſo wiſe in the Cauſe of God, and ſo godly in his life, and ſo conſtant to the death, that he ſhined as a Star moſt clear in the Church by his Example. But to the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Sufferings, his Trouble firſt began for refuſing to ſprinkle his Child after the Papiſtical manner, for which the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> (to whoſe family the ſaid <hi>Thomas Hawkes</hi> had not long before been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39043:90"/>being apprehended and brought before the ſaid Earl, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſent him to <hi>Bonner</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> with a Letter, ſignifying his Crime; his Examinations and Anſwers before the Biſhop are very long, and therefore I have thought meet to inſert only ſome of the chief or moſt principal matters contained therein.</p>
                     <p>Being brought before the Biſhop, the firſt queſtion he askt him, was; <hi>Why he left his Child unchriſtned ſo long?</hi>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:39043:91"/>but bread and water; I perceive I have kept you to well; have I made thus much of you, and have I you at this point? The <hi>Porter</hi> being not in the way, the Biſhop took him aſide, and bid one of his men talk with <hi>Thomas Hawkes</hi> the while; who enquired of <hi>Hawkes, whom he knew in</hi> Eſſex, <hi>and who were his Teachers?</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>I befool your heart could you not have ſaid ſo before? you have wounded this mans Conſcience. Then the Biſhop turned to <hi>Hawkes,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>How ſay you now, Sir, this man is turned, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi>

                           <hi>Well, well, let us go to Evenſong,</hi> with that <hi>Hawkes</hi> turned his back to go out of the Chappel.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>No, I will not; It will not edifie me.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Then ſaid the <hi>Biſhop, I pray you tarry, you may pray by your ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He replyed, I will not Pray in this Place, nor in no ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Then ſaid one of the Chaplains, let him go, <hi>my Lord,</hi> and he ſhall not pertake with us in our prayers.</p>

                     <p>So to prayer they went, and <hi>Tho.

                        <p>I ſay, it is Abominable, Deteſtable, and Blaſphemy againſt God and his Son Chriſt, to call upon any, to turſt to any, or to pray to any but to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>The next day he was brought before <hi>Bonner,</hi> and another old Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; to whom <hi>Bonner</hi> ſaid, This young man hath a Child, and will not have it Chriſtened, and was very angry with <hi>Tho.

                     </sp>
                     <p>Then ſaid the old Biſhop that ſtood by, Alas, young man! you muſt be taught by the Church, and by your Antients, and do as your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers have done before you.</p>
                     <p>Then ſaid Bonner, <hi>No, no, he will have nothing but the Scriptures, and them he underſtands not; he will have no Ceremonies in the Church; what ſay you to holy Water?</hi>

                           <hi>Why? the Scriptures allow it; and we read that</hi> Eliſha <hi>threw Salt into the Water.</hi>

                        <p>It's ture, <hi>Eliſha</hi> threw Salt into the water, and the water became ſweet and good, which before was Corrupted; when our waters are corrupted, if by throwing in your Salt you can make them ſweet and wholſome, we will believe better of your Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39043:95"/>the Biſhop counſelled him to Recant; to which he anſwered, <hi>I am weary to live in ſuch Idolatry as you would have me to live in:</hi> He was ſeveral times afterwards brought before them, and continuing ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his Religion, which the Biſhop perceiving, fell to his laſt and ſtrongeſt Argument, which was to paſs Sentence of Death upon him, and delivered him to the Sheriff of <hi>London;</hi> where he continued till the ninth day of the Month called <hi>June,</hi> and then was carried to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> where his wife and his ſix Children met him; to whom he ſaid, <hi>My Wife and Children, I muſt now depart from you, therefore henceforth know I you no more, but as the Lord hath given you unto me, ſo I again give you unto the Lord;</hi> charging them to fear and obey him and to beware of the abominations of Popery, and ſo ſealed his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Fire.</p>
                     <p>After this <hi>Watts</hi> there were three others ſuffered in this County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> viz. <hi>Thomas Oſmond</hi> Fuller, <hi>William Bamford</hi> Weaver, <hi>Nicholas Chamberla</hi> Weaver, all of <hi>Coxhall;</hi> one and the ſame Articles were objected againſt them all, viz. for denying the Sacrament of the Altar, Auricular Confeſſion, &amp;c. according to the accuſtomed manner, they were ſeveral times brought to the Conſiſtory, where they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flattered, and ſometimes threatened, to ſee if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, after the common uſage of the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and at laſt were condemued as Hereticks, and delivered to the Sheriffs, and ſhortly after were all three burned in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

                     <p>The Words that <hi>John Bradford</hi> ſpoke at the Stake, were to this effect; <hi>O</hi> England, England, <hi>repent thee of thy Sins, repeat thee of thy Sins, beware of Idolatry, beware of falſe Anti-chriſts, take heed they do not deceive you, Strait is the Way, and Narrow is the Gate that leadeth to Eternal Salvation, and few there be that find it.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39043:109"/>your Lead man, and is gone before; if you ſuffer with him you ſhall reign with him? What way can you glorifie the Name of your Heavenly Father better, then by ſuffering death for his Sons ſake? What a Spectacle ſhall it be to the World to behold ſo godly a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as you Servants of God, in ſo juſt a Quarrel as the Goſpel of Chriſt is, with ſo pure a Conſcience, ſo ſtrong a Faith, and ſo lively a hope, to offer your ſelves to ſuffer moſt cruel Torments at the hands of Gods Enenies, and ſo to end your daies in Peace to receive in the reſurrection of the Righteous life Everlaſting.</p>
                        <p>Be ſtrong therefore in your Battel, the Lord God is on your ſide, and his Truth is your cauſe, and againſt you be none but the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, as the Serpent and his Seed, the Dragon with his Tail, the marked man of the Beaſt, the Off-pring of the Phariſees, the Congregation Malignant, the Generation of <hi>Vipers</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi> as their Father the Devil hath been from the beginning. To conclude ſuch are they as the Lord God hath alwayes abhorred, and in all Ages reſiſted and overthrown, God from whom nothing is hid, knoweth what they are, he that ſearcheth the hearts of men, he hath found out them to be crafty, ſubtle, full of Poyſon, Proud, Diſdainfull, Stiff-necked, Devourers, Ravenours, and Barkers againſt the Truth, filthy and ſhameleſs; and therefore doth the Spirit of God by the Mouthes of his holy Prophets and Apoſtles call them by the names of <hi>Foxes, Serpents, Cockatrices, Lyons, Leopards, Bulls, Bears, Wolves, Dogs, Swine, Beaſts,</hi> teaching us thereby to underſtand that their natural inclination is to deceive, poyſon and deſtroy as much as in them lyeth, the faithfull and Elect of God; but the Lord with his right Arm ſhall defend his little Flock againſt the whole rabbler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Worldlings, which have conſpired againſt him; he hath numbered all the hairs of his Childens Heads, ſo that not one of them ſhall periſh without his Fatherly will; he keepeth the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, much more will he preſerve them whom he hath purchaſed with the Blood of the Immaculate Lamb; he will keep them until the hour appointed wherein the Name of God ſhall be glorified in his Saints; in the mean time, let them work their wills, let them Envy, let them Malign, let them Blaſphem, let them Curſe, Ban, Betray, Whip, Scourge, Hang and Burn; for by this means God will try his Elect, as Gold in the Furnance, and by theſe Fruits ſhall they alſo bring themſelves to be known what they be, for all their Sheep skins; for as he that in ſuffering patiently for the Goſpel of God, is thereby known to be of Chriſt, even ſo alſo is the Perſecutor of him known to be a member of Anti-chriſt: Beſides this, their extream cruelty ſhall be a means the ſooner to provoke God to take pity upon his Servants, and to deſtroy them that ſo Tyranniouſly entreat his People, as we may learn by the Hiſtories as well in the Bondage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Eygpt,</hi> as alſo in the miſerable Captivity of <hi>Judas</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where when the People of God were in moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream thraldom, then did the Lord ſtreath forth his mighty Power to deliver his Servants, though God for a time ſuffered them to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39043:109"/>exalted in their own pride, yet ſhall they not eſcape his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, my Brethren, I commit you to God and the Power of his Word, which is able to eſtabliſh you in all Truth, his Spirit be with you, and work alway, that ye may be mindfull of your duties towards him, whoſe ye are both Body and Soul, whom ſee that ye Love, Serve, Dread, and Obey, above all worldly Powers, and for nothing under the Heavens defile your Conſcience before God; diſſemble not with his Word, God will not be mocked? Nay, they that diſſemble with him deceive themſelves, ſuch ſhall the Lord deny, and caſt out at the laſt day; ſuch I ſay as bear two faces in one hood; ſuch as play on both hands; ſuch as deny the known Truth; ſuch as obſtinately rebel againſt him; all ſuch with their partakers ſhall the Lord deſtroy; God defend you from all ſuch, and make you perfect unto the end, your Sorrow ſhall be turned into Joy.</p>

                           <p>I thank you heartily moſt loving Wife for your Letters ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in my impriſonment, I read them with tears more then once or twice, for Joy and Gladneſs, that God had wrote in you ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful a work: Theſe your Letters, and the hearing of your moſt god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedings, and conſtant doing from time to time, have much relieved and comforted me at all times, and ſhall be a goodly Teſtimony with you at the great Day.</p>
                           <p>If I would have given place to worldly reaſons, theſe might have moved me, firſt the foregoing of you, and my Children, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſtate of my Children, being yet tender of Age, and young, apt and inclineable to virtue and learning, and ſo having the more need of my Aſſiſtance, being not altogether deſtitute of gifts to help them withal, poſſeſſions above the common ſort of men; becauſe I was never called to be a preacher or miniſter (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my ſickneſs) fear of death in impriſonment before I ſhould come to my anſwer, and ſo my death to be unprofitable.</p>
                           <p>But theſe and ſuch like, I thank my heavenly Father, who of his infinite mercy inſpired me with his holy Ghoſt for his Sons ſake, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not in me, but when I had by the wonderfull permiſſion of God fallen into their hands, at the firſt ſight of the Sheriff, Nature a little abaſhed yet ere ever I came to the Priſon, by the working of God, and through his goodneſs, fear departed; I ſaid to the Sheriff at his coming, unto me what matter have you to charge me withal: He anſwered, you ſhall know when you come before the Maſters; I lookt to have been brought before the Maſters, and to have heard what they could have burthened me withal, but contrary to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation I was committed forthwith to the Goal, not being called to my anſwer; little Juſtice being ſhewed therein, but the leſs Juſtice
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39043:112"/>a man findeth at their hands, the more Conſolation in Conſcience ſhall he find from God, for whoſoever is of the World, the World will love him.</p>
                           <p>After I came into Priſon, and had repoſed my ſelf there a while, I wept for Joy and Gladneſs my belly full, muſing much of the great mercies of God, and as it were ſaying to my ſelf after this ſort: Oh, Lord, who am I, on whom thou ſhouldeſt beſtow this great mercy, to be numbered among the Saints that ſuffer for the Goſpel ſake. And ſo beholding, and conſidering on the one ſide, my imperfection unableneſs, ſinfull miſery and unworthineſs, and on the other ſide, the greatneſs of Gods mercy, to be called to ſo high promotion; I was as it were amazed, and overcome for a while with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, concluding thus with my ſelf in my heart: Oh, Lord, thou ſheweſt Power in Weakneſs, Wiſdom in Fooliſhneſs, Mercy in Sinfulneſs, who ſhall let thee to chooſe where and whom thou wilt? as I have zealouſly loved the confeſſion of thy Word, ſo ever thought I my ſelf to be moſt unworthy, to be a partaker of the affliction for the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Not long after came unto me M. <hi>Brasbridge</hi> M. <hi>Phinees,</hi> and M. <hi>Hopkins</hi> travelling with me to be diſmiſſed upon bonds; to whom my anſwer was (to my rememberance, after this ſort) for as much as the Maſters have impriſoned me, having nothing to burthen me withal; If I ſhould enter into bouds, I ſhould in ſo doing Accuſe my ſelf, and ſeeing they have no matter to lay to my charge, they may as well let me paſs without bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nds as with bonds.</p>
                           <p>And when they were ſomewhat importune, I ſaid to one of them, that liberty of Conſcience was a pretious thing, and took as it were a pauſe, lifting up my heart to God, earneſtly for his aide and help, that I might do the thing that might pleaſe him; and ſo when they had let their ſure fall, my heart me thought was wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
                           <p>Afterward, debating the matter with my ſelf, theſe conſiderations came into my head; I have from time to time with good Conſcience (God I take to record) moved all ſuch I had Conference withal, to be no dalliers in Gods matters, but to ſhew themſelves after ſo great a light and knowledge, hearty, earneſt, conſtant, and ſtable, in ſo manifeſt a Truth, and not to give place one jot contrary to the ſame; now thought I, if I ſhall withdraw my ſelf, and make any ſhifts to pull my own neck our of the Collar, I ſhall give great offence to my weak Brethren in Chriſt, and advantage to the Enemy, to ſlander Gods Word; it will be ſaid, he hath been a great boldner of others to be earneſt and fervent to fear no worldly perrils, or dangers, but he himſelf will give no ſuch example.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore I thought it my bounden duty, both to God and man, being (as it were) by the great goodneſs of God marvelouſly called and appointed hereunto, to ſet aſide all fear, perril and dangers, all worldly reſpects, and conſiderations, and like as I had hereto accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of my ſmall gift, from the bottom of my heart unfeignedly moved, exhorted and perſwaded, all that profeſs Gods

                           <p>Then they were content that I ſhould have a Bed of my own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, but I was allowed no help night nor day, nor company of any man, notwithſtanding my great ſickneſs, nor yet Paper, Pen or Ink, or Books, ſave my new Teſtament in Latine, and another little Book which I got in privately.</p>

There is none of all theſe my Brethren, which are brought hither as Priſoners, but when they were at liberty, and out of Priſon, diſſented from you and your doings as much as they do now, and for that cauſe they are now Priſoners, ſo that they learned not their Religion in Priſon; and as for me, I never knew them till I was committed Priſoner with them; and as for my fault which you make ſo greivous, whatſoever you judge of me, I am well aſſured that I hold no other Religion then Chriſt Preached, the Apoſtles Witneſſed, the Primitive Church received, and now of late hath been faithfully taught by Evangelical Preachers, for which you have cruelly burned them, and now you ſeek our Blood alſo, proceed on hardly by what rule you will, I fear not.</p>
                     <p>Then the Biſhop proceeded to paſs the Sentence upon him, and then upon the reſt, and after he had condemned them he ridded his

                           <p>My dearly beloved, I beſeech God to reward the great goodneſs that you have ſhewed unto me, ſeven fold into your Boſoms; and as you have alwayes had a moſt godly love unto his Word, even ſo I beſeech him to give you grace to love your own Souls, and then I truſt that you will flee from all thoſe things that ſhould diſpleaſe our good and mercifull God, and hate and abhor all the Company of theſe that would have you to Worſhip God any otherwiſe then is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his holy Word; and beware of thoſe Maſters of Idolatry, that is, theſe Papiſtical Prieſts.

And dear hearts, I do now write unto you for none other cauſe, but to put you in rememberance that I have not forgot you, to the end, that I would not have you forget me, but to remember well what I have ſimply by word of Mouth, and Writing taught you, the which, although it were moſt ſimply done; yet truely, as your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beareth me record; and therefore, in any caſe, take good heed, that you do not that thing which your own Conſcience doth condemn; therefore come out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and go to Heaven-ward with the Servants and Martyrs of God, leaſt you be partakers of the Vengeance of God, that is coming upon this Wicked Nation, from the which the Lord God defend you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus now, I take my leave of you forever in this World, except I be burned amongſt you, which thing is uncertain unto me as yet.</p>

                           <head>Some Sentences taken out of a Letter, written by the ſaid <hi>John Hullier,</hi> are as followeth</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>John Hullier</hi> being of long time Priſoner, and now openly judged for the Teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus, wiſheth heartily to the whole Congregation of God the ſtrength of his holy Spirit to their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting health both for Body and Soul.</p>
                           <p>I now (moſt dear Chriſtians) having the Sweet Comfort of Gods ſaving health, and being confirmed with his free Spirit (be he only praiſed therefore) am conſtrained in my Conſcience, thinking it my very Duty to admoniſh you, as ye tender the Salvation of your Souls, by all manner of means, to ſeperate your ſelves from the Company of the <hi>Popes Hirelings,</hi> conſidering what is ſaid in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> by the Angel of God touching all men, the words be theſe; <hi>If any man Worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his Mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured into the Cup of his wrath, and he ſhall be puniſhed with Fire and Brimſtone before the holy Angels, and before the Lamb; and the Smoak of their Torment aſcendeth up evermore.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Come out from among them and joyn not your ſelves to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Aſſemblies; yea, do not once ſhew your ſelves with the leaſt part of your Body to favour their Wicked doings, but glorifie God (as moſt right is) ſo well in your whole Body outwardly, as inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your Spirit, or elſe you can do neither of both well; for your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth belong to God as well asyour Spirit; at the Dreadfull Day of judgment we ſhall all receive the Works of our Bodies according to that we have done, whether it be good or bad.</p>
                           <p>Therefore whatſoever we do we may not bring the Spirit in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Body, but contrary wiſe we may ſubdue the Body, and the will of the Fleſh to the Spirit, that the Spirit may freely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the will of God in all things; for otherwiſe we ſhall never be Partakers of his Promiſe, with the true Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they which are the Children of the Fleſh, are not the Children of God; if we live according to the Fleſh, we ſhall die; for to be carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace, becauſe that the fleſhly mind is Emnity to God, for it is not obedient to the Law of God, neither can be ſo, then they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</p>
                           <p>Now chooſe you which way you will, take either the narrow Way that leadeth to Life, which Chriſt himſelf, and his faithfull Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, have gone through before; or elſe the broad Path-way which leadeth to Deſtruction, which the Wicked Worldlings take their pleaſure in, for a while; I for my part have now written this ſhort Admonition unto you of good will (as God be my Witneſs) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to that Way which at length you your ſelvos ſhall prove and find to be beſt, yea, and rejoyce thereof: And I do not only write this, but I will alſo (with the aſſiſtance of Gods Grace) ratifie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

                     <p>Sometime after his Wife was had in Examination before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, what her Anſwers were at her Examination are not recorded, but ſhe was kept in Priſon with her tender Infant till they both died; the Child was ſent out of the Priſon, but it was paſt remedy, firſt being almoſt ſtarved with cold and want of things neceſſary, and the Mans Mother, a woman of eighty years of Age, being left in the Houſe after their apprehenſion, for lack of comfort, there periſhed alſo.</p>

                     <p>About this time there was a conſultation held at <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the Clergy, concerning <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> and <hi>Paulus Phagius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up and burning <hi>Martin Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius's</hi> Bones.</note> two perſons dead three or four year before; and after much debating they agreed altogether in this determination, that they were Sectaries and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hereticks, and a ſupplication ſhould be made to the Lords Commiſſioners in the Name of the whole Univerſity, that their dead Carcaſes might forthwith be digged up, for that it was againſt the rule of of holy Canons that their Bodies ſhould be buried in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian burial.</p>
                     <p>And Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> ſent a Commiſſion to make inqueſt upon Hereſie; now after the aforeſaid Condemnation was paſt, and the ſaid Commiſſion was read from the Cardinal, Doctor <hi>Pern</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red proceſs might be ſent out for <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius</hi> to appear, or any other that would take upon them to plead their Cauſe, to which the Commiſſioners condecended, and the next day proceſs went out to cite the Offenders, which Citation was fixed up in ſeveral publick places in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and ſoon after Witneſſes were ſworn and examined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius,</hi> and a time was ſet for a Jury to bring in their Verdict, and in the mean time a Commandment was given forth by the Commiſſioners, for bringing in all Heretical Books; and a day there was appointed, for Judgment to be given againſt theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; but when the day came, and that neither <hi>Bucer</hi> nor <hi>Phagius</hi> would appear at their call in the Court, nor that any put forth himſelf to defend them, yet the curteous Commiſſioners would not proceed to Judgment (which for their contumacy in abſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they might have done) conſidering how that day was peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to ſhew their mercy and equity, had rather ſhew ſome favour then to take the extent of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, <hi>Vincent</hi> publiſhed the ſecond Proceſs; and ſtuck it up in publick places as before, putting off the day of Judgment from the eighteenth to the twenty ſixth day of the ſame Moneth, which day being come, the Mayor and Burgeſſes were warned to be preſent when the Sentence was publiſhed, which was done by Doctor <hi>Scot</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chester,</hi> in which Sentence he condemned <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius</hi> of Hereſie; after the Sentence, the Biſhop commanded their Bodies to be digged out of their Graves, and being degraded from holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, delivered them into the hands of the ſecular Power; then the Cardinal was advertiſed how far they had proceeded, and he was deſired that the Writ <hi>De Heretico Comburendo</hi> might be ſent to <hi>Smith</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And it pleaſed God to deliver me, with four more out of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers hands, requiring nothing elſe of us, but that we ſhould be honeſt men, and Members of the true Catholick Church, which we affirmed we were Members of, and purpoſed by Gods help therein to die; hereupon we were delivered, and he wiſht us ſeveral times to ſpeak well of him, and no doubt he was worthy to be praiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been ſo faithfull a helper in his Maſter the Devils buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for he had burnt <hi>John Philpot</hi> the ſame morning, in whoſe blood his heart was ſo drunk, that he could not tell what he did, as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39043:130"/>to us,<note place="margin">Q. Mary. An. <hi>1556.</hi>
                           </note> both before and after; for but two dayes before he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us, that we ſhould be condemned that ſame day we were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and the next day after he had delivered us, he ſought earneſtly to take ſome of us again, he waxed dry after his great drunkenneſs; wherefore, he is like to have Blood to drink in Hell, as he is worthy, if he repent not with ſpeed; the Lord turn all their hearts if it be his Will.</p>
                        <p>After I was delivered, the Papiſts ſaid, I had conſented unto them, rejoycing thereat; the which I praiſed God, was not the leaſt in my thoughts, but they perceived the contrary in a little time; for I went from Pariſh to Pariſh, and talked with them, to thirteen at leaſt, and that of the chiefeſt in the County, which ſo angered them, that the Commiſſioners complained againſt me to Sr. <hi>John Gaye,</hi> Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, who ſent out four or five Warrant to apprehend me, but having warning of their laying in wait for me, I kept out of their way, ſo that the Bailiffs miſt of their prey, and were much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but three dayes after the Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> ſent three of his men to apprehend me, I being at Plough with my Folks in the way coming to my Houſe, not miſtruſting them, came to them, and ſpake to them; they ſaid, that they Arreſted me in the King and Queens Name, and that I muſt go with them, which ſuddain words made my Fleſh to Tremble and Quake; yet I anſwered them, that I would go with them, and deſired them to go to my Houſe firſt, they ſaid I ſhould. Then I remembered my ſelf, ſaying in my heart, why am I thus afraid, they can lay no evil to my charge, if they Kill me for well doing, I may think my ſelf happy; I remembred how I was formerly contented, and glad to die in that Quarrel, and ſo had continued ever ſince; and ſhould I now fear to die, God forbid that I ſhould, for then were all my Labour in vain; then I praiſed God, I was ſatisfied, having conſidered it was but the frailty of my Fleſh, which was loath to leave Wife, Children and Goods; I ſaw nothing but preſent Death before mine Eyes, and as ſoon as I was perſwaded in my mind to die, I had regard of nothing in this World, but was as joyfull as ever I was: This Battel laſted not a quarter of an hour, but I dare ſay, it was ſharper then Death it ſelf for the time.</p>
                        <p>When I had got my Breakfaſt, I deſired them to ſhew me their Warrant, thinking thereby I might ſee wherefore I was Arreſted, that I might be the better able to make my defence; but one of them anſwered, they had not their Warrant there; at which words, God put it into my minde, that I need not to go with them unleſs they had their Warrant; and I ſaid, it's much you'l come to take a man without a Warrant, and therefore ſet your hearts at reſt, I will not go with you, unleſs you carry me by force, and ſo I roſe up from the Board, and ſtept into my Chamber, thinking to go from them, if I could poſſible, ſeeing God had made the way ſo open for me; I meant to play <hi>Peters</hi> part with them, but God would not have it ſo, but ſent a fear amongſt them, that before I came out of my Chamber again they were gone out of my Houſe.</p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:39043:130"/>
                        <p>When I ſaw that, I knew it was Gods doing to ſet me at liberty once again; yet I was compelled to ſpake to them, ſaying, if you have a Warrant I deſire you to ſhew it me, and I will go with you, if not, I defire you to depart in peace, for ſurely I will not go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the order of the Law; I have been too ſimple in ſuch things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, for when I was ſent firſt to Priſon the Juſtices ſent for me by one of their men, without any Warrant, and I went gently to them to two Seſſions, and they ſent me to Priſon, and kept me there almoſt a year and three quarters, contrary to right and equity, and it ſeemeth ſtrange to me that I ſhould be thus evilly handled; therefore, I will go to none of them hence forward without legal order. Then one of them ſaid, we have not the Warrant here, but it is at my Houſe, the worſt is, you can but make us fetch it: Then ſaid I, fetch it if you will, and ſo I ſhut my door, and before they came back with a Conſtable, as God would have it, I was gone forth, but they ſearched every corner of my Houſe, and at night there came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men and a Conſtable to ſearch again, but I kept abroad; and becauſe I ſuppoſed they would lay wait for me, and thinking they would not miſtruſt that I dare be nigh home, I told my Wife I would make my Lodging in a Wood near my Houſe, as I did, under a Tree, and there had my Bible, Pen and Ink, and other neceſſaries, and there I continued ſix or ſeven weeks; then there came word into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that I was ſeen and ſpoken with in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereupon they left laying wait for me, for God put in my mind that they would lay wait for me at all Sea-Coaſt Towns, as they did.</p>
                        <p>So when all was huſht, I went abroad among our Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and at length I went beyond the Seas, both into <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but I thought the time long till I came home again; I was there but three weeks, but it was known among <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, who could not abide it, but got Warrants and ſearched my Houſe for me, ſometimes twice in a week, ſometimes I went privily, ſometimes openly from home, ſtaying abroad two or three weeks together, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile living a Moneth together at home, doing openly ſuch work as I had to do, and yet mine Enemies laid no hands on me, till the hour was fully come, and then mine own Brother, according to the fleſh, delivered me into their hands.</p>

                        <p>Grace Mercy and Peace from God the Father, and from his Son our only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, by the operation and Working of the

                        <p>Wherefore, dear Siſter, let our Faith be made manifeſt to the World by our deeds, and in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let your Light ſhine as in a dark place.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>O dear hearts, now is the Goſpel of God overwhelmed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny black and troubleſome Clouds of Perſecution, for the which cauſe very few go about to have their Eyes made clear by the true light of the Goſpel, for fear of looſing their <hi>Treaſures</hi> of this World, which are but vain, and ſhall Periſh.</p>
                        <p>Let us not therefore, be like unto them which light their Candle, and put it under a Buſhel, but let us ſet our Candle upon a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, that it may give light unto all them that are in the Houſe; that is to ſay, let all the People of the Houſhold of God ſee our good works, in ſuffering all things patiently that ſhall be laid upon us for the Goſpel ſake, if it be Death it ſelf; for Chriſt died for us, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps; and as he hath given his Life for us, ſo ought we to give our Lives for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Goſpel to the comfort of our Brethren.</p>
                        <p>How is it then that ſome will ſay, that their Faith is good, and yet they do all the deeds of Anti-chriſt the Devil; St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with the heart juſtifieth, and to confeſs with the Mouth maketh a man ſafe:</hi> Here may all ſee, that no man or woman can have a true Faith unleſs they have deeds alſo, and he that doubteth, is like the Waves of the Sea, Toſſed about of the Wind, and can look for no good thing at the Lords hands: Now is the acceptable time that Chriſt ſpoke of, yea, even now is the <hi>Ax</hi> put to the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> that ſo every <hi>Tree</hi> that bringeth not forth good <hi>Fruit,</hi> muſt be hewn down and caſt into the Fire.</p>
                        <p>Now is the Lord come with his Fan in his hand to try the Wheat from the Chaff, the Wheat he will gather into his Barn, and the Chaff he will burn: Now is the time come that we muſt go meet the Bridegroom with Oyle in our Lamps; we are alſo bidden to the Feaſt, let us make no excuſes, our Maſter hath delivered <hi>Talents</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: Now is the Lord come to ſee if there be any <hi>Fruit</hi> upon his <hi>Trees,</hi> if he find none, he will ſerve us as he did the wild <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> that is, <hi>Never Fruit ſhall grow on him more:</hi> If we go to meet the Bridegroom without Oyle in our Lamps, and ſhould go to buy, the doubt is, we ſhould be ſerved as the Fooliſh Virgins were, to whom

Allerton</hi> replyed, The firſt is that which you hold; the ſecond is clean contrary to the ſame; and the third is a Neuter: Then ſaid <hi>Bonner, Of which of theſe three art thou of? Allerton</hi> ſaid, I am of that which is contrary to that which you teach to be believed on the pain of death; after ſome other diſcourſe between them, the Biſhop in a rage called him <hi>Knave,</hi> and <hi>Whorſon Prick-louſe, and demanded what he had to ſay, why he ſhould not pronounce the Sentence of condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</hi> to which he anſwered. You ought not to condemn me, for I am a Chriſtian, but do as you have determined, for I ſee right and truth are ſuppreſſed, and cannot appear upon the Earth; theſe words ended, the Biſhop pronounced the Sentence of death againſt him, and delivered him to the <hi>temperal Officers,</hi> who on the day afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, cauſed him and the other three to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>There is not much Recorded what paſt in the <hi>Tryal</hi> of the other three, only <hi>James Auſtoo,</hi> when he was brought upon Examination before the Biſhop in his Chappel at <hi>Fulham,</hi> the Biſhop ſaid to him, <hi>Doſt thou know where thou art,</hi> and before whom; to which he replyed, I know where I am, for I am in an <hi>Idol-temple,</hi> whereupon the Biſhop paſt Sentence againſt him and his Wife, who ſuffered deeply, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Biſhops Houſe, being kept in his Dog-kennel, under a pair of Stairs.

                     <p>Dearly beloved, be not troubled with this heat that is now come among you, to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto you, but rejoyce, inſomuch as you are partakers of Chriſts Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,

                     <p>It is better, if the will of God be ſo, that you ſuffer for well-doing, then for evil-doing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. See that none of you ſuffer as a <hi>Murderer,</hi> or as a <hi>Thief,</hi> or an <hi>Evil-door,</hi> or as a <hi>Buſie-body,</hi> in other mens matters; but if any man ſuffer as a <hi>Chriſtian-man,</hi> let him not be aſham'd, but let him glorifie God in this behalf; for the time is come that <hi>Judgment</hi> muſt begin at the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> If it firſt begin at us, what ſhall the end of them be that believe not the Goſpel of God? Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the Will of God, commit their Souls to him in well-doing.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer Perſecution.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. See that ye love not the World, neither the things that are in the World; if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him: For all that is in the World, as the luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World, which vaniſheth away and the Luſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but he that fulfileth the Will of God abideth forever</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3. If ye be riſen again with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God: Set your affection on things that are above, and not on things which are on Earth.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, that believe in me, it were better for him that a <hi>Milſtone</hi> were hanged about his neck, and that he were caſt into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. Great are the troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all; fear the Lord ye his Saints; for they that fear him lack nothing.</p>
                     <p>When the Righteous cry, the Lord heareth them, and delivereth them out of all their troubles; but misfortune ſhall ſlay the ungodly, and they that hate the Righteous ſhall periſh.</p>
                     <p>Hear, Oh my People, I aſſure thee, Oh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if thou wilt heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto me, there ſhall so ſtrange God be in thee, neither ſhalt thou Worſhip any other God: Oh that my People would obey me; for if <hi>Iſrael</hi> would walk in my wayes, I would ſoon put down their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and turn my hand againſt their Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor yet the Servant above his Lord; it is enough for the Diſciple to be as his Maſter is, and that the Servant be as his Lord is, if they have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Maſter of the Houſe <hi>Belzebub,</hi> how much more ſhall they call them of his Houſhold ſo; fear not them therefore.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Set your ſelves therefore at large, and bear not a ſtrangers Yoke with the Unbelievers, for what fellowſhip hath <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> with <hi>Unrighteouſneſs?</hi> What Company hath <hi>Light</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>For neither Eye hath ſeen, nor the Ear hath heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man, what good things the Lord hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Ye are brought neither with Silver nor Gold, but with the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>William Seaman,</hi> was an Husbandman, of the age of twenty ſix years, dwelling in <hi>Mendleſham</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">William Seaman <hi>Martyr.</hi>
                        </note> he was perſecuted by one Sr. <hi>John Terril,</hi> who ſearched his houſe for him by night, but miſſing of him, he ſet his ſervants to ſearch for him, and when they had apprehended him, brought him before their Maſter, who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, why he would not go to Maſs, and receive the Sacrament, <hi>Seaman</hi> replyed, becauſe it was an Idol he would not receive it; wherefore <hi>Terril</hi> ſent him to <hi>Hopton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> to deal with him, who after he had examined him, ſoon paſſed his bloody ſentence of death againſt him; This <hi>Seaman,</hi> when he died, left behind him a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39043:141"/>Wife, and three young Children, which her Husband being taken away, one would have thought ſhould have moved thoſe pretended Chriſtians to ſome pity towards her, but inſtead of ſhewing pity, they perſecuted her out of the Town of <hi>Mendleſham,</hi> becauſe ſhe refuſed to hear Maſs; and one <hi>Coles,</hi> Lord of the ſaid Town, cauſed all her Goods, and Corn, to be ſeized and taken away.</p>
                     <p>Another of theſe Sufferers, was <hi>Thomas Hudſon,</hi> of <hi>Aileſham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> he was thirty years of age, by trade a Glover, and a very honeſt poor man, having a Wife and three Children, and labouring alwayes dilligently in his imployment, being zealous for that Truth which bore teſtimony againſt the Papiſts blaſphemous preaching, who put the Draugh and Darnel for the Wheat, and that he might avoid their Idolatries, and Superſtition he abſented from his houſe, and went into <hi>Suffolk</hi> a long time, and there remained, traveling from one place to another, at laſt he returned home again to comfort his Wife and Children, being troubled at his abſence, when he was come home, he conceiving his continuing there would be dangerous, he and his Wife deviſed to make him a place among his Fagots, to hide himſelf in, where he remained all day exerciſing himſelf in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and prayer, and thus he continued for about the ſpace of half a year; but at laſt his Zeal and Courage aroſe, and he walked abroad ſeveral dayes openly in the Town, crying out continually, againſt the Maſs, and ſuch like trumpery, and for three dayes and three nights together refuſed meat, or to talk with any; one <hi>Berry</hi> Vicar of the Town, and one of the Biſhops Commiſſaries, cauſed the Officers to watch for him, who upon the twenty ſecond day of the Month called <hi>April,</hi> apprehended him by the break of the day, and led him to <hi>Berry</hi> the Commiſſary, who examined him after this manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doeſt thou not believe, ſaid</hi> Berry, <hi>in the Sacrament of the Altar, what is it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hudſon</hi> replyed, it is worms meat, my belief is in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Berry, <hi>Doſt thou not believe the Maſs to put away Sins?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hudſon,</hi> No, God forbid, it is a patcht Monſter, and a diſguiſed Puppet, more longer a piecing, then ever was <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple.</p>
                     <p>At which words <hi>Berry</hi> ſtamped and fumed, and ſaid, <hi>Well, thou Villain, I will write to my Good Lord the Biſhop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſaid, There is no Lord but God.</p>
                     <p>Then he asked <hi>Hudſon, whether he would Recant?</hi> to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the Lord forbid; I had rather die many deaths then do ſo.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Thomas Hudſon,</hi> and the other two being brought to the <hi>Lollards-pit,</hi> and there ſtanding with Chains about them, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain <hi>Thomas Hudſon</hi> came forth from under the Chain, which made ſome to doubt that he would have recanted, but his two Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the Stake exhorted him, and comforted him, in the Bowels of Chriſt; but <hi>Hudſon</hi> felt more in his Heart and Conſcience then they did conceive was in him, for he was compaſſed with great grief of mind, not for his death, but for lack of the feeling of Chriſt, for which he kneeled down, and prayed earneſtly unto the Lord, who at laſt according to his mercies gave him comfort, and then he ſaid,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:39043:142"/>now I thank God I am ſtrong, and ſo went to the Stake to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows again, and they all ſuffered conſtantly, and joyfully to the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of the Lords Name.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed to give a further Account of ſuch as ſuffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, its neceſſary to give a ſhort Account of the ſaid end of this Perſecuting Commiſſary <hi>Berry,</hi> who Perſecuted <hi>Thomas Hudſon,</hi> and others to death, as I find it recorded.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Berry</hi> in his rage was very fierce againſt many godly People in the Town of <hi>Aileſham,</hi> he burnt all good Books he could get, and perſecuted men for their Conſciences, and compelled many to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and being Rich, and in great Authority, he had the more power to Perſecute; he divorced many men and women for Religion, he was a great Swearer, and given to Women, (to write ſaith the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) how many <hi>Concubines</hi> and <hi>Whores</hi> he had, would be incredible; but mark what Judgments the Lord brought upon him for his <hi>wickedneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On a time, a poor man ſpeaking a word to him, he ſtruck him ſuch a blow, with the ſwingle of a ſtaile, that he preſently died thereon, for which (as is ſaid) <hi>Berry</hi> held up his hand at the Bar.</p>
                     <p>And ſhortly after one <hi>Alice Oxes,</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>Aileſham,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Houſe, and going into the Hall, he met her (and being before moved) ſmote her with his fiſt, whereby ſhe was fain to be carried home, and the next day was found dead in her Chamber.</p>
                     <p>When this Prieſt heard that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was dead, and that the glory of their triumph quailed, the day called <hi>Sunday</hi> following, he made a great Feaſt,<note place="margin">A Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon a Perſecutor.</note> and had one of his <hi>Concubines</hi> there preſent, with whom he was in his Chamber after Dinner, until he went to that he called his Evening-ſong, where he Miniſtred Baptiſm, and as he was going home, between the Grave-Yard and his Houſe, he fell down ſuddainly to the ground with a heavy graon, and never ſtirred after, and thus the Judgments of God was evidently ſeen to be Executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, by all that beheld him.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Moneth that the aforeſaid three ſuffer'd at <hi>Norwich,</hi> there was two men and one woman burnt at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> viz. <hi>William Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Richard Day,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian George.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next Moneth, being the Moneth called <hi>June,</hi> a ſhort, but ſharp Proclamation came forth to prohibit the ſpreading ſeveral good Books, therein condemned under the title of Hereſie and Sedition, laying the injunction ſo ſtrickt, that whoſoever ſhould be found to have any ſuch Books in their cuſtody after the Proclamation came forth, ſhould be reputed as Rebels, and to be Executed forthwith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of Martial Law.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after ſeveral perſons were apprehended, being aſſembled in a religious exerciſe in a back Cloſe near <hi>Iſlington,</hi> two and twenty of whom were committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and there remained ſeven weeks before they were Examined, ſeven of theſe two and twenty were afterwards burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> and ſix at <hi>Brainford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of them, viz. <hi>Reginald Eaſtland</hi> being required by the Biſhop to anſwer upon Oath to the Articles charged againſt him, refuſed,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:39043:142"/>ſaying an Oath was to end ſtrife, but to begin ſtrife (ſaid he) and Oath is not lawful; and therefore chooſed rather to ſuffer what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they would inflict upon him, then to ſwear the matter againſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Bonner</hi> had paſt Sentence upon <hi>Roger Holland,</hi> one of them that was burnt in <hi>Smithfield, Roger</hi> ſpoke to this effect; I am ſaid he Moved by the Spirit of God to ſay, that God will ſhorten your hand of cruelty, and after this day in this place ſhall there not be any put to the Tryall of Fire and Faggot, and as he was ſpeaking and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People, the Biſhop turned back and charged the Keeper, that none ſhould ſpeak with him without leave; being brought to the Stake, he ſpake after this manner; <hi>Lord I moſt humbly thank thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that thou hast called me from the ſtate of Death, unto the Light of thy heavenly Word, and now unto the fellowſhip of thy Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>No ſaid ſhe, it is the Spirit of God which leadeth me, and which called me in my Bed at Midnight, and opened his Truth to me. Then the Prieſts and others, <hi>Shouted and laughed at her:</hi> When the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was read againſt her, and ſhe was condemned to be burnt to death; ſhe lifted up her Voice, and ſaid, <hi>I thank thee my Lord, my God, this day have I found that which I have long ſought for:</hi> At which words, <hi>They mockt her,</hi> and ſo being brought to the Stake, ſhe was as lively and cheerful in her Countenance, as if ſhe had been prepared for that day of her Marriage, to meet the Lamb; and ſo ſhe ended this Mortal Life. She was a Woman very patient in her Words and Anſwers, in her Apparel, Meat and Drink, moderate and ſober, and would never be Idle, and was a great comfort to ſuch as talked with her; and in her trouble ſhe refuſed to take Money, ſaying, whilſt I am here God has Promiſed to feed me, and I am going to a City where there is no need of Money: And in the time of her ſuffering ſhe forſook Husband Children, who Perſecuted her becauſe ſhe would not ſtoop to Idolatry, and when after Sentence and Judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt her, they offered her that if ſhe would recant and turn, her life ſhould be ſpared: Nay, ſaid ſhe, God forbid that I ſhould loſe life Eternal for this life; I will never turn from my heavenly Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to my earthly Husband, from the fellowſhip of Angels to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Children. If my Husband and Children were faithful, then am I theirs; God is my Father, my Siſter, my Brother, and my Friend moſt faithful.</p>

                     <p>A Kinſwoman ſeeing him in this condition, gave the Keeper forty pence to take him out of the Stocks, he took her Money, and let him out to eat his Supper, and at ſeven of the clock he put him in the Stocksagain, and ſo he remained till two of the clock the next day.</p>

                     <p>When <hi>John Lithal</hi> was Examined before the Chancellor, who asked him, <hi>What Church he was of, and why he came not to his Pariſh Church?</hi>

                        <p>Then ſaid the <hi>Proveſt,</hi> I arreſt you all in the Emperors name and commanded each of them to be Bound, to wit, the Husband and his Wife with their two Sons, leaving their two Daughters to look to the Houſe; now as they conveyed them along through the Streets, <hi>Baudicon,</hi> with a voice ſomewhat extended, which might
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39043:152"/>eaſily be heard at that time of the night, ſaid Aſſiſt us, O Lord by thy Grace, not only to be Priſoners for thy Name ſake, but to confeſs thy holy Truth in all purity before men, ſo far as to ſeal the ſame with our Bloods, for the edification of thy poor Church.</p>
                        <p>Thus were they brought into ſeveral Priſons, where they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally handled, yet ceaſed they not to bleſs and praiſe the Lord with one conſent; within a few dayes after, they were brought before the Magiſtrates of the City, and Examined, who firſt ſpoke to the Father in theſe words, <hi>It is told us, that you never come to Maſs, and alſo diſwade others from coming thereto, and that you maintain Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in your Houſe, whereby you have Tranſgreſſed the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Robert</hi> anſwered to this effect, We read not in all the Scriptures that either Chriſt or any of his Apoſtles ever ſaid Maſs; for they knew not what it meant: As for the ſecond Accuſation, I cannot, nor will deny, but there have met together in my Houſe Honeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fearing God, I aſſure you not with intention to wrong or harm any, but rather for the advancement of Gods Glory, and the good of many; I knew indeed that the Emperour had forbiden it, but what then, I know alſo that Chriſt had commanded it, who ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> Thus you ſee I could not well obey the Emperour, but I muſt diſobey Chriſt; in this caſe then, I choſe rather to obey my God then man.</p>
                        <p>When they were brought to the Fire, the laſt words they were heard to pronounce were, Jeſus Chriſt, thou Son of God, into thy hands we commend our Spirits; and ſo they ended their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Within eight dayes after <hi>Jane</hi> the Mother, and <hi>Martin</hi> her Son were both Executed in the ſame City.</p>

                        <p>When they purpoſe to torture any one, the Gaoler is commanded to bring forth his Priſoner into the accuſtomed place where it is to be given, which place is under the Earth, and very obſcure, then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow many turnings, and thorow ſundry Doors, ſo as the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible cries of thoſe who are there tortured can in no wiſe be heard, there is a Seat prepared for the Inquiſitors on high, with a Rigiſter alſo, to behold their Tragical Act; the Torches being lighted, thoſe who are to Act their parts in this woful Tragedy are brought in, the Tormentor who attends their coming is covered all over with a black Garment, cloſe to his Body, and on his Head a black Hood, which hides his Face from being ſeen, having only two or three holes made therein for himſelf to ſee and to breath at; and all this is to terrifie the more the poor patient, who beholdeth as it were a grim Devil ready to Torment him; theſe Fathers being ſet upon their Seat, begin again to charge the Priſoner voluntary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Truth, which if he refuſe to do, and if it then happen, that

                        <p>The Man or Woman ſtanding naked, then only covered with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bretches, they beckon to the Tormenter, (who is well aquainted with their ſecret ſign and watch word, and can readily diſcern what Torments the holy Fathers would have them put to, to teach them the Faith of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then ſtanding thus naked, they exhort them once again to tell the <hi>truth.</hi> If the Patient be to endure the <hi>Cord,</hi> they tye his hands behind his back pulling him up eight or ten times, according to the number of twitches limited by the Inquiſitors to the Tormentor, that ſo nothing may be done there without order; at the firſt encounter are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to him all his Articles, and then, beſides binding his hands, they tye his <hi>Thumbs</hi> together with a ſmall Cord, then they tye his <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Tumbs</hi> unto a greater Cord, hoiſting him up by a Pulley very high, which done, they put upon his Legs heavy Bolts, if he have not them on before, to which are yet added for the firſt pull, an Iron weight of twenty five pounds, which is hanged to thoſe Bolts between his Feet; being thus arrayed the Tormenter draws him up on high, the Regiſter and Inquiſitor mixing therewith their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Exhortations, confeſs; when he comes to touch the Pulley with his Head, they urge him yet then to confeſs; if he obey, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let him down, if not, then they let him hang in this condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he have anſwered their demands; now after he hath hung thus without making any Confeſſion, they let him down to redouble on his feet the former weight, and then pulling him up again, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, to hang there till he die, if he declare not to them, what they ask of him, commanding thet Tormenter to let him hang a long while, that through the heavineſs of the weight, which hangs at his Feet, all his Members and Joynts are ſtretched out beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; when the Patient through the extremity of Torment which he endures cryes out, they in like ſort cry as loud as they can, that he ſhould now confeſs what he knows, if not, then they let him fall; for when they perceive he continues conſtant, then they command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Officer to let go the Cord, which is as ſoon done as ſpoken, yet not wholly and altogether to the mid way, but a certain ſtop which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:39043:153"/>hinders his falling to the ground, by reaſon whereof he receives ſuch a ſuddain check, his Body is pitifully and miſerably ſtretched.</p>
                        <p>But yet this ſufficeth not, for then if through their importunity he will confeſs nothing, they augment the weight the third time, and if the poor creature, in regard of his intollerable pain, call upon the Lord to help him, and deſire to be let down, then they Scoff and Mock at him, preſſing him to confeſs, telling him, that is not all, threatning him by the <hi>Strappado,</hi> as before. This <hi>Helliſh Torture</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at nine, and laſteth till one a clock; and when they pleaſe to make an end, they ask the <hi>Tormenter,</hi> if he have the other Engines ready, and at their going, all the comfort they give their diſſolate Patient, is thus; this ſhall ſuffice, ſay they, for this time, but look between this and to morrow, thou adviſeſt thy ſelf well, what thou oughteſt to confeſs, other wayes, thou art like to die under <hi>Torture;</hi> nor think to eſcape by what thou haſt endured, for that is but a Bed of Roſes in regard of the <hi>Torment</hi> which is to come; they being gone, his clothes is put on, and if he be not able to go, he is carried again unto Priſon; a few dayes after they ſend for him again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their threats, that if he will not reveal thoſe that are of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, he muſt prepare himſelf for the <hi>Torture,</hi> wherein if he any way miſcarry, or Death follows, the fault ſhall be his, and not theirs; if he continue unmovable in his mind, they cauſe the Goaler to bring him to the place of <hi>Torture,</hi> and there they ſitting in their <hi>Tribunal</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to be ſtripped naked, and then tormented after the ſame manner as is before related; beſides, as an addition thereunto, they tye his thighes and hamſtrings together with a ſmall Cord, forcing the ſame with pieces of Wood, ſo that the Cords do eat into his very Fleſh, in which extremity they leave him for three or four hours plying him the whilſt with infinite threats and deriſions, which is all the comfort that they miniſter unto him in this his moſt miſerable condition.</p>

                        <p>A Woman of <hi>Tours</hi> (whoſe Husband the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had not long before drowned) having an Infant ſucking at her Breſt, about ſeven weeks old, and a Daughter about ſixteen Years Old, who was very beautiful; this Woman accompained with her Children, they hailed to the River ſide, where kneeling down, ſhe prayed to the Lord, the Child ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at her Breſt, then ſhe ſhifted her Child in the Sun, and laid it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Graſs, commending it to God, in the mean while this Helliſh Crew uſed many words to turn the Young Maid from her Religion; the Mother being ready to be plunged into the Water, exhorted her Daughter to perſiſt in the Truth; the Daughter beholding their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, cryed out in theſe words, I will, ſaid ſhe, live and die with my Mother, whom I know to be a virtuous woman; as for your threats and promiſes, I regard them not, do with me what you pleaſe: The

                        <p>The one of her Kindred meeting her in the way preſented to her veiw her little Children, praying her to have compaſſion on them, ſeeing that by renouncing your Religion, you may preſerve your life. This cauſed the tears to flow down, and this anſwer ſhe made, I muſt needs ſay, <hi>I love my Children dearly, but yet neither for love I bear to them, or any thing elſe in this World, will I renounce the Truth, or my God, who is and will be a Father unto them; and therefore to his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Protection I commend and leave them;</hi> and ſo paſſed on, and with cheerfulneſs finiſhed her <hi>Teſtimony</hi> with the loſs of her life.</p>
                        <p>The Body of <hi>Coqueville</hi> being ſtripped naked, was dragged by the Murtherers from <hi>Valongues</hi> (being low <hi>Normandy</hi>) up and down his Houſe with deriſion into a Chamber, where they uſed to meet, and there ſpurning the dead body with their feet, they bid him, <hi>Now pray to his God, and preach if he could;</hi> the Prieſts ſtuffing the dead Mouth with the leaves of Bibles, and ſaid to the dead Corps, <hi>Preach the Truth of your God, and call upon him now to help you.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is well known that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſing all their endeavorus to rule over this Country at their pleaſures had no better opertunity, to accompliſh their deſigns then to eſtabliſh among them their Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thereby todomineer over the goods, honors and lives of every one; the noble Citizens and Commons did what they could to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame, to which purpoſe they had inſtantly beſought the King to afford them his Royal preſence, that hearing once their Complaints, his Majeſty might take ſome order for matters of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, alledging to this end the Example of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> his Father, who upon a buſineſs far inferiour to this, adventured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with much diligence to paſs through the Enemies Country, who were but a while before reconciled, only to ſtay ſome Mutinies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the City of <hi>Cand.</hi> Theſe things had ſo moved the King that he made them a promiſe by Letters of his coming; but his intentions were broken of by ſuch as were the upholders of the Inquiſition, that ſo they might with the more facility attain the end of their deſires, inſtead of their King then, they had ſent unto them the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who at his Entrance found the Priſons repleniſhed with Gentlemen, and other Perſonages of note, whom the Dutcheſs of <hi>Parma</hi> had left in bonds after her death.</p>

                           <p>Seeing it is the will of God, that we ſhould ſuffer for his holy Name and in the Quarrel of his Goſpel; we certifie you, Brethren, that we are hitherto of good courage, howſoever the fleſh continually rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, counſelling it ever and anon according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Old Serpent; but we are well aſſured that Chriſt who hath bruiſed, will alſo ſtill bruiſe the Serpents Head, and not leave us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs; true it is, we are now and then pricked in the heel, but that is all the Serpent can do, nor are we diſcouraged, but keep our faith cloſe to the Promiſes of God, who is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, having created all things of nothing: He forſook not <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Eygpt,</hi> nor left the three Young Men in the fiery Furnace; no nor <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den; this is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of their Righteous Poſterity, ſo that we can without fear ſay with the Prophet <hi>David, The Lord is my Help, Tower, Strength and Refuge:</hi> By ſuch, and the like Scriptures, dear Brethren, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves in our Bonds, rejecting all confidence in man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; be not diſmayed then, good Brethren and Siſters, for our Bonds and Impriſonment, for ſo is the good will of God now towards us; and therefore pray rather, that he would give us grace to perſevere conſtantly unto the End, ſo be it.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>One of theſe three impriſoned in <hi>Antwerp</hi> wrot a few Lines to the Church of God in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> as followeth; Brethren, I write unto you, being left alone; whereas we were three in number, <hi>John Hues</hi> is now dead in the Lord, I did my beſt to comfort him whileſt he breathed ſo as now I am alone, and yet not altogether alone, ſeeing the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> is with me, he is my exceeding great Reward, and will not fail to reward me as ſoon as I have laid down this earthly Tabernable: Pray unto God that he would ſtrengthen me to the end, for from hour to hour I expect the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this houſe of Clay.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Joris</hi> one of the three was examined before the Magiſtrates, the Marqueſs ſaid unto him, <hi>I have hitherto ſpared you, hoping to ſee you recant, but you grow worſe and worſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joris</hi> replyed, during the time of my Impriſonment I have ſhed many tears; and further ſaid, he was now become reſolute, and could not faſhon himſelf according to their deſire, although they burnt him as they had done his Brother <hi>Schoblant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Marqueſs, <hi>I can tell you, it will coſt you but little better cheap.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joris,</hi> I am ready if it be to morrow.</p>

                        <p>Then ſaid one of the Standers by, he has neither Wife, Child nor Goods to loſe, and that makes him ſo willing to dye.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Joris,</hi> You ſhall anſwer theſe your doings at the laſt day, where you muſt all appear, and then there will be no reſpect of perſons.</p>
                        <p>Marqueſs, <hi>We have heard you preach too long; take him Goaler, and caſt him into the Hole;</hi> then was he put among Thieves as a Lamb among ſo many Wolves: Thus this conſtant Witneſs remained firm till death.</p>
                        <p>The Spectacles of dead Bodies ſlain by the Bloody Inquiſition was a Dreadful ſight, being gazed on in a manner, in every place, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the City of <hi>Tournay,</hi> and of the <hi>Valentians;</hi> in regard of the multitudes of Believers, both of men and women; who had long Languiſhed in ſundry Priſons, in great miſeries and neceſſities. Now that we may not forget what fell out in the beginning of this Year 1569. Thus it happened in the City of <hi>Valence,</hi> ſeven and fifty perſons were executed for no other cauſe but for cleaving to the true Faith of Chriſt Jeſus, not without much aſtoniſhment of the poor people of that City.</p>
                        <p>Among theſe ſad Relations, a little to quicken and refreſh the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Reader, I will here inſert a Letter, full of Conſolations, written out of Priſon, to the Faithful, by one <hi>William Tovart,</hi> Merchant, who had his dwelling in the City of <hi>Lile</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This honourable perſon being come to the Age of Eighty Years, or thereabouts, uſed his Houſe for the ſpace of Fourteen or Fifteen Years for the Aſſembly in the City of <hi>Lile</hi> to meet in: Being cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Baniſhed thence in the Year 1561. he withdrew himſelf for a while to <hi>Tournay,</hi> whence he was conſtrained to flie, and to go to <hi>Amiens</hi> and <hi>Moundediea,</hi> Cities of <hi>Prickardy;</hi> afterwards returning into his own Country, he came to reſide in the City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where after he had continued many Years, he was at length condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be burnt with two others, who ſuffered for the ſame cauſe, but they put him to another kind of Death, for they drowned him by plunging him in a Ciſtern of Water in Priſon. Amongſt many Letters which he wrote, during the time of his Impriſonment, my Author hath ſelected out this one, which here followeth.</p>

                              <p>I moſt humbly thank my God, that he hath ſo fortified and comforted me by his Grace, that I feel my ſelf more cheered by lying in this dark Priſon, then if I were walking in the open Streets or Fields; I ſay, this I feel accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit, for as touching the Fleſh, what doth it apprehend here, but ſtinking Vapours and Smoke. Wherefore, my beloved, if it ſo fall out, that you be apprehended for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt; fear not the priſon, nor thoſe that have power to Kill the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for having done that, they can go no further; be not afraid then, ſeeing it is the reward which our good Captain Jeſus Chriſt hath Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to all his Faithful Souldiers and Servants; he who turns his back in this conflict goes by the loſs; but whoſoever fights manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obtains in the end the Crown; not a Crown of Gold, but of

                     </note> as far as I can give a diſcovery by the Authors I could procure.</p>
                  <p>As I have ſaid, though by the forciable courſe the Biſhops took, theſe People were kept under at times, yet in the one and thirtieth year of the Queen, the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> Flames brake forth again, and Books were written by the names of <hi>Martin-Marprelate,</hi> and another Book by <hi>Penry</hi> and <hi>Udal</hi> againſt the Government of Biſhops, and <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood</hi> wrote a ſhort Treatiſe, called, a <hi>Plat-Form,</hi> in which was contained ſharp reproofs to the Clergy, ſaying, That all falſe and Antichriſtian Miniſters, ought by the Princes Authority to be rooted out, and that their Antichriſtian and Idolatrous Livings ought to be converted to chartiable Civil-uſes, and are not to be appropriated or given to Gods true Miniſtry, for the maintenance thereof, neither ought it to receive the ſame; for it ſtands not with the honour of God, that <hi>Bethel,</hi> Gods Houſe, ſhould be garniſhed and ſupported with the things belonging to, or taken from <hi>Bethaven,</hi> the Houſe of Idols, as if the Almighty wanted other means for ſupport of his own Houſe, and muſt needs be beholden to the Houſe of Idols to help him and his.</p>
                  <p>For theſe, and ſuch matters by them openly divulged, they were impriſoned, and all that would not bow, the Biſhops reſolved to break them to pieces; on the other hand, the more hotly they were perſecuted by the Biſhops, the more the Zeal ſtirred in them to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſtrengthening themſelves daily through their diligence in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures, that they might be enabled to oppoſe the Clergy, whoſe Reformation they ſaid was no more then caſting out the name and Perſons of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and yet reſerved all their Livings and Priviledges, even all the fat and gainful Ware of <hi>Amaleck</hi> unto themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But in the end of theſe things, as it ſeldom hath been known, ſo far as I have obſerved, that whenſoever the Truth appeared, though in the leaſt Meaſure, but it coſt ſome Blood, which ſhould make men love it the better: So in theſe times, this <hi>Barrow, Greenwood</hi> and <hi>Penry,</hi> and ſeveral others, ſealed their Teſtimony, firſt by hard Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and at laſt by death it ſelf, as in the ſequel will appear; and if what I find upon record be true (as I have no cauſe to believe otherwiſe) the chief Inſtruments of their deaths were the Clergy, and not the Queen: For when the Queen asked Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> what he thought of thoſe two men (meaning <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood</hi>) he anſwered, It would not avail any thing to ſhew his Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, ſeeing they were put to death, and being loath to ſpeak his mind further, the Queen preſſed him, and charged him to ſpeak, whereupon he anſwered, that he was perſwaded if they had lived, they would have been two as worthy Inſtruments for the Church of God, as hath been raiſed up in this Age: The Queen ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid no more: But after that riding to a Park, by a place where they were executed, called to mind their ſuffering of death, (and being willing to have further information concerning them) deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                     <p>And therefore we humbly and earneſtly crave of her Majeſty and your Lordſhips, both for our ſelves abroad, and for our Brethren now in miſerable Captivity; <hi>but juſt and equal Tryal, according unto her Majeſty's Laws, if we prove not our Adverſaries to be in a moſt Peſtilent and godleſs courſe, both in regard of their Offices, and their Proceedings in them, and our ſelves to be in the right Way, we deſire not to have the benefit of her Majeſtyes true and faithful Subjects, which of all earthly favours we account to be one of the greateſt.</hi> Are we Malefactors?

                     <p>They ſhould not by the Laws of this Land go any further in Caſes of Religion, then their own Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, and then refer us to the Civil power; their Fore-fathers <hi>Gardner, Bonner</hi> and <hi>Story</hi> dealt thus equally, <hi>and we crave but this Equity:</hi> Oh let her Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty our Soveraign, and your Wiſdoms conſider and accord unto this our juſt Petition; for Streams of Innocent Blood are like to be ſpilt in ſecret by theſe Blood-thirſty-men, except her Majeſty and your Lordſhips, do take order with their moſt cruel and inhuman proceedings.</p>
                     <p>We crave for all of us but the Liberty, <hi>either to die openly, or to live openly in the Land of our Nativity.</hi> If we deſerve death, it beſeemeth the Majeſty of Juſtice not to ſee us cloſely murthered, yea, ſtarved to death with hunger and cold, and ſtifled in loathſome Dungeons: If we be guiltleſs, we crave but the benefit of onr Innocency, viz. <hi>That we may have</hi> peace to ſerve our God and our Prince in the place of the Sepulcher of our Fathers.</p>

                           <p>I ſee my blood layd for (my Beloved) and ſo my dayes and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny drawing to an end, for ought I know; and therefore I think it my duty to leave behind me this Teſtimony of my love, towards ſo dear a Siſter and loving a Wife in the Lord, as you have been unto me. Firſt then, I beſeech you, ſtand faſt in that Truth which you and I profeſs at this preſent in much outward diſcomfort and danger, let nothing draw you to be ſubject to Antichriſt, let your Soul and your Body be far from thoſe Aſſemblies which yield either known or ſecret ſubmiſſion unto the Ordinances of the Beaſt. Oh! our Souls are to rejoyce in theſe wayes more then in all Subſtance and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the loving-kindneſs of the Eternal is forever and ever towards them and thier Seed that remember his ordinances to do them. My dear Wife and Siſter, look not at any earthly thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate your ſelf wholely both Soul, Body, Husband, Children,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:39043:162"/>and whatſoever you have unto the Lord your God; let them not be dearer unto you then his Worſhip and Service; fear not the want of outward things, for the Lord careth for you and yours; the Lord is my God and yours, and the God of our Seed; I know if you and our poor Children continue, that they ſhall ſee a bleſſed Reward even in this life; be much and often in prayer day and night, and much in reading and meditating; above all things, pray that the Lord would reſtore beauty unto his Church, and ſo would overthrow the curſed Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Anti chriſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part thereof; remember me alſo and my Brethren now in Bonds, that the Lord would aſſiſt us with the ſtrength and comfort of his Spirit, to keep a good Conſcience, and to bear a glorious Teſtimony to the end; be not out of hope but I may be reſtored again unto you, therefore be earneſt in prayer for my deliverance; yet if the Lord ſhall end my dayes in this Teſtimony, bleſſed be his Name; howſoever it goeth, I am ready and content with his good pleaſure, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhift you make, keep our poor Children with you, that you may bring them up your ſelf in the Inſtruction and Information of the Lord; I leave you and them indeed nothing in this Life, but the bleſſing of my God; and this my Siſter, I doubt not, ſhall be found an ample Portion both for you and them, though you know that in hunger often, and cold often, in poverty and nakedneſs we muſt make an account to profeſs the Goſpel in this Life; and teach them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, even now in their youth that Leſſon, <hi>If they will reign with Chriſt, they muſt ſuffer with him;</hi> teach them the meanneſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that they are not to look for greatneſs in this Life, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to make account that they are to yield their lives, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they have for the Truth; break their affections betimes, while they are yet green, by Inſtructions and Corrections meet for them; when they are capable of handy labour I know you will not let them be Idle: Thus having disburdened my ſelf of my duty towards you, and of my care to you and your poor Children in ſome part, I am, I thank God, in great comfort, though under great Tryals of my weakneſs and conſideration of my own wants, not in regard of men, I fear not any power or ſtrength of man whatſoever, and I am this hour willing to lay down my Life for my Teſtimony, and I truſt ſhall be unto the end; you know I was taken at a Meeting at <hi>Ratliff</hi> the two and twentieth day of the third Moneth 1592. and committed cloſe by M. <hi>Younge</hi> to the <hi>Powltry Counter;</hi> ſome dayes after, ſome were ſent privately to confer with me, I anſwered, for private Conference, inaſmuch as my Cauſe was made publick, I ſaw no Cauſe why I ſhould yield unto any, I deſired publick upon equal conditions, they ſaid no, and after much needleſs ſpeech departed.</p>

                           <p>To draw to an End, ſalute the whole Church from me, eſpecially thoſe in Bonds, and be you all much and heartily ſaluted in the Lord,

                     <p>I find that in the year 1604. in this Kings Reign, four Perſons were baniſhed the Land of <hi>England,</hi> after they had ſuffered three Moneths Impriſonment, for no other cauſe but ſeperating themſelves from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> refuſing to Communicate joyn or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with the ſame in their publick Miniſtry and Worſhip, reputing many corruptions to be ſtill remaining amongſt them, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Popery.</hi>

                     <p>And thus, I have given an Account of ſuch as ſuffered, for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in thoſe times; and now to conclude, I have this further to write, by what I have obſerved upon Hiſtories in ſeveral Ages, viz. That while any People were under Suffering and Oppreſſion for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, endeavouring to ſerve and worſhip God in that Way they believed to be moſt agreeable to the Scriptures of Truth then the publick Way eſtabliſhed in the Kingdom: whilſt they travelled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Bondage and Suffering they were low in their minds, and the Lord had regard unto them, for their hearts were tender, and the Lord appeared for them; and now, when the Lord had tryed this People, and at laſt put Power into their hands, and raiſed them as it were from a low eſtate, they ſoon forgot his kind dealings with them; as for Example, the <hi>Independants</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> ſome of whom I have ſeen, neer forty years ſince, dregged out of their Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in private Houſes, and their Cloathes tore, and their Faces co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (as it were) with dirt, and their blood ſpilt; and in this ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition they made many Covenants and Vowes to the Lord; but this very People afterwards coming into Places of Authority, and killing, and taking Poſſeſſion, got themſelves into the High-Places of the Earth, and ſoon forgot their time of deep Sufferings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted into Goverment, they tread in the ſame ſteps thoſe had trodden that were their great Perſecutors, and then they turn'd as riggid Perſecutors, if not worſe, then thoſe they had turned out, as witneſs the Innocent Blood they ſhed both in <hi>Old-England</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> whoſe Cruelty (under the Viſor of a more righteous Cloak) is too large here to inſert, but will be matter ſufficient for another Volum and therefore I here conclude this.</p>

                     <p>After he was dead, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ordained another Biſhop in his room, who being at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> after he had received the <hi>Cardinals</hi> bleſſing, going down a pair of Stairs from the Chamber, he fell down and broak his Neck: to theſe Examples alſo may be added, the terrible Judgment of God upon the Parſon at <hi>Crundall</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> who having received the Popes Pardon from Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> coming home to his Pariſh, exhorted the People to receive the ſame, ſaying, <hi>That he now ſtood as clear in his Conſcience as when he was firſt born, and mattered not if he died the ſame hour he ſpoke it;</hi> whereupon, being ſuddainly ſtricken by the Hand of God, and leaning a little on the one ſide, immediately ſhrunk down in the Pulpit, and ſo was found dead, not ſpeaking one word more.</p>

                     <p>And thus the Reader may ſee all along throughout the Scriptures, and by the record of Antient Hiſtories,<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> how God hath avenged the the Cauſe of his People againſt all Perſecutors for Conſcience ſake, of every Age almoſt from the beginning unto theſe Times, and now theſe Examples may be a Warning to the Perſecutors of this Age, who have made Spoil of the People of God, and have the Spoil in their Houſes; and though ſuch Oppreſſors may be lifted up, becauſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſpeedily executed; yet let ſuch conſider their wayes and repent before it be too late, for the Lord is at the Door, and beholds the Actions of ſuch as grind the face of his People, and though he hath long forbearance, yet his Judgments will come, if there be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in time. Return therefore whilſt ye have time. (O ye Perſecutors, and wicked Men) for the day of the Lord is at hand, It ſhall come as a Deſtruction from the Almighty; therefore ſhall all hands be faint, and every mans heart ſhall melt, and they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; Pangs and Sorrows ſhall take hold upon them; they ſhall be in Pain as a Woman that travelleth; they ſhall be amazed one at an other; their faces ſhall be as Flames: Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with Wrath and fierce Anger to lay the Land deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and he ſhall deſtroy the Sinners thereof out of it, and will puniſh the World for their Evil, and the wicked for their Iniquity, and will cauſe the arrogancy of the Proud to ceaſe, and will lay low the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the Terrible.</p>

                        <p>Perſecution for the cauſe of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is againſt the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, the King of Kings, as theſe Scriptures and Reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing do demonſtrate.</p>

                     <head type="sub">The firſt Reaſon againſt Perſecution is, becauſe it is contrary to Scripture.</head>
                     <p>FOr Chriſt commanded, that the Tares and Wheat ſhould be let alone in the World,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.30.38. &amp;c</note> and not pluckt up until the Harveſt, which is the End of the World.</p>

                     <p>Again, he reproved his Diſciples, who would have had Fire come down from Heaven,<note place="margin">Luke 9.54, 59.</note> and devour thoſe <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who would not receive him, in theſe Words, <hi>Ye know not of what Spirit ye are; the Son of man is not come to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle taught,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 24.2.</note> that the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but muſt be gentle towards all men, ſuffering the evil men, inſtructing them with meekneſs that are contrary-minded, proving if God at any time will give them Repentance, that they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Truth, and come to amendment out of that Snare of the Devil.</p>

                     <p>But he chargeth ſtraitly (that his Diſciples ſhould be ſo far from perſecuting thoſe that would not be of their Religion) that when they were perſecuted, they ſhould pray; when they were Curſed,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> they ſhould Bleſs, &amp;c. And the reaſon ſeems to be, becauſe they who now are Tares, may hereafter become Wheat; they who are now Blind, may hereafter ſee; they that now reſiſt, him, may hereafter receive him; they that are now in the Devils ſnare, in adverſneſs to the Truth, may hereafter come to Repentance; they that are now Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and Perſecutors (as <hi>Paul</hi> was) may in time become faithful as he; they that are now Idolatrous, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> once were,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9.</note> may

                        <p>The ſecond Reaſon againſt Perſecution for cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is, becauſe it is againſt the Profeſſion and Practice of famous Princes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrſt, Conſider the ſpeech of <hi>King James</hi> to the Parliament 1609. he ſaith, <q>It is a ſure Rule in Divinity, that God never loves to plant his Church by Violence and Bloodſhed; and that it was uſually the Condition of Chriſtians to be perſecuted, but not to perſecute.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, he ſaith, page four, ſpeaking of the Papiſts; <q>I gave good proof, that I intended no Perſecution againſt them for Conſcience Cauſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the ſame Kings Expoſition of the Revelation the twentith, printed 1588. he writes thus; <q>
                           <hi>Compaſſing of the Saints, and beſeiging of the beloved City,</hi> declareth unto us a certain <hi>Note</hi> of a falſe Church to be Perſecution; for they come to ſeek the faithful; the Faithful are them, that are ſought; the Wicked are the Beſiegers, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the Beſieged.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath thus written, <q>And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſucceſs of the latter Times (wherein Sundry Opinions have been hatched about the ſubject of Religion) may make one clearly diſcern with his Eye, and as it were to touch with his Finger, that according to the Truth of the Scripture, and a <hi>Maxime</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maintained by the antient Doctors of the Church, that mens Conſciences ought in no fort to be violated, urged, or conſtrained; and whenſoever men have attempted any thing, by this violent courſe, whether openly, or by ſecret means, the iſſue hath been <hi>Pernitious,</hi> and the cauſe of great and wonderful Innovations in the Principaleſt and Mightieſt Kingdoms and Countries of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further he ſaith: <q>So that once more we do profeſs, before God and the whole World, that from this time forward we are firmly reſolved, not to perſecute or moleſt, or ſuffer to be perſecuted or moleſted, any perſon whoſoever, for matter of Religion, no not thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> neither to trouble nor diſturb them in the Exerciſe of their Religion, ſo they live conformable to the Laws of the States, &amp;c.</q>

                        <p>The Third Reaſon, becauſe Perſecution for Cauſe of Conſcience, is condemned by the antient and later Writers.</p>
                     </argument>

                        <hi>HIlary</hi> againſt <hi>Auxentius,</hi> ſaith thus, The Chriſtian Church doth not perſecute, but is perſecuted. And Lamentable it is to ſee the folly of theſe Times, and the fooliſh Opinion of this World, in that men think by humane Aid to help God, and with Wordly Pomp and Power to undertake to defend the Chriſtian Church: I ask the Biſhops, what help uſed the Apoſtles, in the publiſhing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? with the Aid of what power did they Preach Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Heathen from their Idolatry to God? When they were in Priſons, and lay in Chaines, did they praiſe and give thanks to God for any dignities or favours received from the Court, or do you think that <hi>Paul</hi> went about with regal Mandates, or kingly Authority, to gather and eſtabliſh the Church of Chriſt? Sought he Protection from <hi>Nero Veſpatian?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles wrought with their hands for their own Maintenance, travelling by Land and Water, from Town to City; to preach Chriſt; yea, the more they were forbidden, the more they taught and preached Chriſt; but now, alas, humane help muſt aſſiſt and protect the Faith, and give the ſame Countenance too, and by vain and worldly Honours do men ſeek to defend the Church of Chriſt, as if he by his Power were unable to perform it,</p>
                     <p>The Church formerly by enduring Miſery and Impriſonment was known to be a true Church: The pretended Church now do terrifie others by Impriſonment, Baniſhment and Miſery, and boaſteth that ſhe is highly eſteemed of the World, when as the true Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be hated of the ſame.</p>

                        <q>It agreeth both with human Reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Equity, that every man worſhip God uncompelled; neither beſeemeth it any Religion, to compel another to be of their Religion, which willingly and freely ſhould be imbraced, and not by conſtraint; foraſmuch as the Offerings were required of thoſe that freely and of good will offered, and not from, the contrary.</q>

                        <hi>Brentius</hi> upon the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 3. <q>No man hath power to make, or give Laws to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whereby to bind their Conſciences; for willingly, freely and uncompelled, with a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39043:178"/>ready deſire, and cheerful mind, muſt thoſe that come, run unto Chriſt.</q>

                        <hi>Luther</hi> in his Books of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> ſaith, <q>The Laws of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrates</hi> Government extends no further then over the Body or Goods, and to that which is external, for over the Soul God will not ſuffer any man to rule, only he himſelf will Rule there; wherefore whoſoever doth under take to give Laws unto the Souls and Conſciences of men, he uſurpeth that Government himſelf, which appertaineth unto God, &amp;c.</q>

                        <q>Therefore upon 1 Kings 5. In the building of the Temple, there was no ſound of Iron heard, to ſignifie, that Chriſt will have in his Church a free and a willing People, not compelled and conſtrained by Laws and Statutes.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, he faith upon Luke 22. <q>It is not the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is defended by the ſecular Arm, or humane Power, but the falſe and feigned <hi>Church,</hi> which although it carries the name of a <hi>Church,</hi> yet it denies the power thereof.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. he ſaith, <q>For the true <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not <hi>Brachium ſeculare,</hi> which the Biſhops now adayes chiefly uſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in <hi>Poſtil Dom.</hi> 1 <hi>poſt Epipham,</hi> he ſaith, <q>Let not Chriſtians be commanded, but exhorted; for he that willingly will not do that whereunto he is friendly exhorted, he is no Chriſtian; wherefore they that do compel thoſe that are not willing, ſhew thereby that they are not <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Preachers, but worldly Beadles.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again upon 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. He, ſaith <q>If the Civil Magiſtrate ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to believe thus and thus, I ſhould anſwer him after this manner; look you to your civil or worldly Government, your Power extends not ſo far as to command any thing in Gods Kingdom; therefore herein I may not hear you; for if you cannot bear it, that any ſhould uſurp Authority, where you have to command, how do you think that God ſhould ſuffer you to thruſt him from his Seat, and to ſeat your ſelf therein?</q>

                        <p>Some remarkable Obſervation, collected out of a Book, entituled, <hi>ΘΕΟΛΟΓΙΑ ΕΚΛΕΚΤΙΚΗ, A Diſcourſe of the Liberty of Propheſying;</hi> ſhewing the unreaſonableneſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to othermens Faith, and the Iniquity of perſecuting different Opinions; by <hi>Jer. Tayler D. D.</hi> (ſo ſtiled) Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin in Ordinary to his late Majeſty.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN his Epiſtle Dedicatory are theſe words: <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>As contrary as Cruelty is to Mercy, as Tyranny to Charity; ſo is War and Bloodſhed to the Meekneſs and Gentleneſs of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further ſpeaks, to diſpute men into Mercies, Compliances and Tolerations mutual; and further adds.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>I deſigned a Diſcourſe to this purpoſe, with as much greedineſs, as if I had thought it poſſible with my Arguments to have perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rough and hard handed Souldiers to have disbanded preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for I had often thought of the Propheſie, that in the Goſpel, our Swords ſhould be turned into Plow-ſhares, and our Spears into Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-hooks.</p>
                        <p>I thought it my duty to plead for Peace and Charity, and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Permiſſions mutual.</p>
                        <p>Although we muſt contend earneſtly for the Faith, yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention muſt be with Arms ſit for the Chriſtian Warfare, the Sword of the Spirit, the Shield of Faith, &amp;c. but not with other Arms; for a Church-man muſt not be a Striker, for the Weapons of our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not Carnal, but Spiritual.</p>
                        <p>I being moſt of all troubled, that men ſhould be perſecuted, and afflicted, for diſagreeing in ſuch opinions, which they cannot with ſufficient grounds obtrude upon others neceſſarily, becauſe they cannot propound them infallibly.</p>
                        <p>Conſiderations (are to be had) to the Perſons of men, and to the Laws of Charity more then to the triumphing in any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>If the Perſons be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their life, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their profeſſion; if they acknowledge the Eternal Son of God for their Maſter, and the Lord, and live in all relations as becomes Perſons making ſuch profeſſions, why then ſhould I hate ſuch Perſons whom God loves, and who love God, who are pertakers of Chriſt, and Chriſt hath a Title to them, who dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, becauſe their underſtandings have not been brought up like mine, have not had the ſame Maſters, they have not met with the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39043:179"/>ſame Books—have not the ſame Opinions that I have, and do not determine their School Queſtions to the ſame ſence of my Sect or Intereſt?</p>
                        <p>And whatſoever is againſt the Foundation of Faith or contrary to good Life—or deſtructive to humane ſociety—is out of the limits of my Queſtion, and doth not pretend to compliance or toleration.</p>
                        <p>The fault I find and ſeek to remedy is, That men are ſo dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and reſolute in their Opinions, and impatient of others diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing in thoſe things wherein is no ſufficient means of Union and Determination, but that men ſhould let Opinions and Problems not be obtruded as Axioms, nor Queſtions in the vaſt collection of the Syſteme of divinity be adopted into the Family of Faith.</p>
                        <p>Its hard to ſay, that he who would not have men put to death or puniſhed corporally for ſuch things, for which no human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is ſufficient for Cognizance, or Determination, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent for infliction; that he perfwades to an indifferency when he refers to another Judicatory, which is competent, ſufficient, infallible, juſt, and highly ſevere—for God alone muſt be Judge of theſe matters, who alone is Maſter of our Souls, and hath the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over humane underſtanding—God alone is Judge of erring Perſons.</p>
                        <p>I earneſtly contend, that another mans Opinion ſhall be no Rule to mine, and that my Opinion ſhall be no Snare and Prejudice to my ſelf; that men uſe one another ſo charitably, that no error or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence tempt men to Hypocriſie; this very thing being one of the Arguments I uſed to perſwade Permiſſions, leſt Compulſion intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Hypocriſie, and make Sincerity troubleſom, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>From the Dictates of holy Scriptures; it is obſervable, that this, with its appendant degrees, I mean, reſtraint of Propheſying, impoſing upon other mens underſtandings, being Maſters of their Conſciences, and lording it over their Faith, came in with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and train of Antichriſt, as other abuſes and corruptions of the Church did, by reaſon of the iniquity of the times, and the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt heats of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the increaſe of intereſt, and the abatements of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſimplicity, when the <hi>Churches</hi> fortune grew better, and her Sons grew worſe, and ſome of her Fathers worſt of all: For in the firſt three hundred Years there was no ſign of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting any man for his Opinion, though at that time there were very horrid Opinions commenced—and they who uſed all means —<hi>Chriſtian</hi> and Spiritual, for their diſimprovement and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thought not of uſing corporal force—and therefore I do not only urge their not doing it, as an Argument of the unlawfulneſs of ſuch proceeding, but their defying it, and ſpeaking againſt ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes as unreaſonable, and deſtructive to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> for ſo <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> is expreſs, <hi>Humani juris &amp; naturalis poteſtatis uni cuique quod puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit colere, ſed nec religionis eſt cogere religionem quae ſuſcipi debet ſponte non vi:</hi> its of humane right and natural power for every one to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39043:180"/>what he thinks; but neither is it the part of Religion to compel Religion, which ought to be undertaken of its own accord.</p>
                        <p>The ſame is the Doctrine of <hi>Cyprian, Lactantius, Hillary, Minutius, Faelix, Sulpitius, Severus, Chriſoſtom, Hierom, Auſtin, Damaſeen, Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact, Socrates Scholaſticus,</hi> and <hi>Bernard.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All wiſe Princes till they were over-born with Faction, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by peeviſh perſons, gave Toleration to differing Sects— But at firſt there were ſome heretical perſons, that were ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, they were the men that firſt intreated the Emperor to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Catholicks: but till four hundred years after Chriſt, no Catholick perſons, or very few, did provoke the ſecular Arm, or implore its aid againſt the Hereticks; ſave only that <hi>Arrius</hi> behaved himſelf ſo ſeditiouſly and tumultuarily that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a temporary Decree for his relegation; but it was ſoon taken off, and God left to be his Judge.</p>
                        <p>But as the Ages grew worſe, ſo men grew more cruel and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and in the Greek Church <hi>Atticus</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Theodocius</hi> of <hi>Synoda,</hi> and ſome few others, who had forgotten the mercies of their great maſter, and their own duty, grew implacable, and furious, and impatient of contradiction.</p>
                        <p>It was a bold and arrogant Speech which <hi>Neſtorius</hi> made in his Sermon before <hi>Theodotius</hi> the younger; <hi>Damihi, O Emperator, terram ab Haereticis repurgatam &amp; ego tibi viciſſim coelum dabo; diſperde mecum Haereticos, &amp; ego tecum diſperdam Perſas;</hi> which is in Engliſh, O Emperor, give to me the Land purged from Hereticks; and I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, will give thee heaven: deſtroy me the Hereticks, and I will deſtroy with thee the <hi>Perſians:</hi> It was as groundleſs, as unwarrantable, as it was bloody and inhumane. And we ſee the contrary events prove truer; for <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Princes, and have the reputation of great piety; but they were ſo far from doing what <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had ſuggeſted, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him from his violence and immanity; and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did highly commend <hi>B. Proclus,</hi> for his ſweetneſs of deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards erring perſons, far above the cruelty of his Predeceſſor <hi>Atticus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the experience which <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> hath had in this laſt Age, is Argument enough, That Tole ration of differing Opinions is ſo far from diſturbing the publick peace, or deſtroying the Intereſt of Princes, and Commonwealths, that it doth advantage the Publick, it ſecures the Peace, becauſe there is not ſo much as the Pretence of Religion left to ſuch perſons to contend for, it being already indulged to them.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>France</hi> fought againſt the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> the ſpilling of their own Blood was Arguments enough of the imprudence of that way of promoting Religion; but ſince ſhe hath given permiſſion to them, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The great inſtance is in the differing Temper, Government, and Succeſs which <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had; the clemency of the firſt had almoſt extinguiſhed the Flame; but when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39043:180"/>ſhe was removed, D. <hi>Alva</hi> ſucceeded, and mannaged the matter of Religion with Fire and Sword, he made the Flame ſo great, that his Religion, and his Prince too, had both been almoſt turned out of the Countrey; <hi>Pellie medioſapientiam quoties vi res agitur,</hi> ſaid, Ennius, [<hi>Wiſdom is driven out, when the matter is acted by force.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>[And therefore the beſt of men, and moſt glorious of Princes, were alwayes ready to give <hi>Toleration.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euſebeus</hi> in his ſecond Book of the life of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> reports theſe words of the Emperor, <hi>Parem cum fidelibus ij qui errant pacis, &amp; quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis fruitionem gaudentes accipiant: ipſa ſi quidem communicationis &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietatis reſtitutio ad rectam etiam veritat is viam perducere poteſt; nemo cuiquam moleſtis ſit, quiſque quod animo deſtinat hoc etiam faciat; Let them which err with joy receive the like fruition of Peace and quietneſs with the Faithful, ſith the reſtoring of communication, and ſociety may bring them into the right Way of Truth: Let none give moleſtation to any; let every one do as he determines in his mind.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed there is great reaſon for Princes to give Toleration to diſagreeing perſons, whoſe Opinions cannot by fair means be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if the perſons be confident, they will ſerve God according to their perſwaſions; and if they be publickly prohibited, they will privately convene, and then all thoſe inconveniences, and miſchiefs, which are Arguments againſt the permiſſion of Conventicles, are Arguments for the publick permiſſions of differing Religions, &amp;c. — they being reſtrained, and made miſerable, indears the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented perſons mutual, and makes more hearty and dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>James</hi> in his Letters to the States of the <hi>United-Provinces,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>March</hi> 6.1613. thus wrot—<hi>Ita ut prohibeatis Miniſtros veſtros ne eas diſputationes in ſuggeſtum aut ad plebem ferant, ac diſtricte impertis ut pacem colant ſe in vicem tolerando in iſta opinionum ac ſententiarum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepantia —So that you may forbid your Miniſters, that they bring not thoſe Diſputations into the Pulpit, or to the People, and ſtrictly command, that they embrace peace among themſelves, by Tolerating in that difference of Opinions and Judgments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The like Counſel in the diviſions of <hi>Germany,</hi> at the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was thought reaſonable by the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and his excellent Son <hi>Maximilian;</hi> for they had obſerved, That Violence did exaſperate was unbleſt, unſuccesful, and unreaſonable; and therefore they made Decrees of Toleration.</p>
                        <p>And the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> repenting of his War, undertaken for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt the <hi>Piedmontans,</hi> promiſed them Toleration; and was as good as his word — As much is done by the Nobility of <hi>Polenia:</hi> ſo that the beſt Princes and the beſt Biſhops gave Toleration and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punities (but it is known, that the firſt Perſecution of diſagreeing Perſons was by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> by <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and from them they of the Church took Example, &amp;c.) And among the <hi>Greeks</hi> it became a publick and authorized practiſe, till the queſtion of Images grew hot and high; for then the Worſhippers of Images,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39043:181"/>having taken their example from the Empreis <hi>Irene,</hi> who put her ſon's eyes out for making an Edict againſt Images, began to be as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, as they were deceived, eſpecially, being encouraged by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who then blew the Coales to ſome purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>I may upon this occaſion give account of this affair in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is remarkable that till the time of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>A.

                        <p>And I have heard it obſerved as a bleſſing upon S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (who was ſo merciful to erring Perſons) as the greateſt part of his life—to tolerate them, and never to indure that they ſhould be given over to the ſeculer power to be killed) that the very night the <hi>Vandals</hi> ſet down before his City of <hi>Hippo,</hi> to beſiege it, he died, and went to God; being taken from the miſeries to come.</p>

                        <p>The firſt that preached that Doctrine was <hi>dominick,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Begging Order of <hi>Friars:</hi> The <hi>Friars</hi> Preachers, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of which the Inquitiſion is intruſted only to the <hi>Fryars</hi> of his order; and if there be any force in Dreams, or truth in Legends, &amp;c. — This very thing might be ſignified by his mothers Dream, who the night before <hi>Dominick</hi> was born, dreamed ſhe was brought to bed of a huge Dog, with a Fire-brand in his mouth; ſure enough, however his Diſciples expound the Dream, it was a better ſign that he ſhould prove a <hi>Rabid</hi> furious incendiary then any thing elſe, what ever he might be in the other parts of this life; in this Doctrine he was not much better, as appears in his deportment towards the <hi>Abli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi> againſt whom he ſo preached — <hi>Adeo quidem ut centum he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticorum millia ab octo millibus catholicorum fuſe &amp; interfecta fuiſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biantur,</hi> ſaith one of him, and of thoſe who were taken, one hundred and eighty were burned to death, becauſe they would not abjure their Doctrine; this was the firſt Example of putting erring Perſons to death, that I find in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>By this time I hope it will not be thought unreaſonable to ſay, He that teaches mercy to erring Perſons teaches indifferency in Religion, unleſs ſo many Fathers, and ſo many Churches, and the beſt of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and all the World (till they were abuſed by Tyranny, Popery and Faction) did teach indifferency: For;</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE ought to be allowed in the dayes of the Goſpel, in the free Exerciſe of it to God-ward (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Compulſion) in all things relating to His Worſhip, for theſe REASONS following.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe the General and Univerſal Royal-Law of Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7.12. <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the Law and Prophets</hi>—That which every man would have, and receive from another, he ought by Chriſt RULE to give and allow it to another. But every man is willing to have the LIBERTY of his OWN CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE, therefore ought to ALLOW it to another.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe no man can perſwade the Conſcience of another, either what God is, or how he ſhould be worſhipped, but by the Spirit, which God hath given to inſtruct man in the Ways of Truth.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe, all Obedience or Service that is obtained by force, is for fear of Wrath, and not from Love, nor for Conſcience ſake; and therefore will but continue ſo long as that fear or force abides upon them.</item>
                        <item>4. Becauſe, that by forcing, no man can make a Hypocrite to be a true Believer; but on the contrary, many may be made Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</item>
                        <item>5. Becauſe, that in all forced Impoſitions upon mens Conſciences,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39043:184"/>there is ſomething of the wrath of man exerciſed, which works not the Righteouſneſs of God, but rather begets enmity in the heart one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another.</item>
                        <item>6. Becauſe, that by forcing any thing upon mens Conſciences, as to matters of Faith and Worſhip, many are hardened in their hearts againſt the things impoſed; when as otherwiſe, through Love and gentle Inſtructions their hearts might be perſwaded to willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</item>
                        <item>7. Becauſe, that Perſecution for Conſcience contradicteth Chriſts Charge, <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. who bids that the Tares (or falſe Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) be ſuffered to grow together in the Field (or World) till the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt (or End of the World.)</item>
                        <item>8. Becauſe, Force is contrary to the end for which it is pretended to be uſed <hi>(viz.)</hi> The preſervation and ſafety of the Wheat, which End is not anſwered by Perſecution, becauſe the Wheat is in danger to be plucked up thereby, as Chriſt ſaith.</item>
                        <item>9. Becauſe to Force is inconſiſtant with the belief of the Jews Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion (and other falſe Worſhippers) which is prayed for by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teachers, and cannot be attained, if Perſecution for Conſcience be proſecuted.</item>
                        <item>10. Becauſe they that impoſe upon mens Conſciences, exerciſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over mens Faith, which the Apoſtles denied, ſaying, <hi>They had not Dominion over any mans Faith.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>11. Becauſe, Impoſition upon mens Conſciences neceſſitates them to ſin, in yielding a Conformity contrary to their own Faith; for whatſoever is not of a mans own Faith, is ſin.</item>
                        <item>12. Becauſe, that Impoſition and Force wreſtles with fleſh and blood, and carnal Weapons, which are contrary to the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who ſaid, <hi>Our Weapons are not Carnal, but Spiritual, and Mighty through God; and we wreſtle not with Fleſh, and Blood.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>13. Becauſe, there is but <hi>One Judge, Law giver</hi> and <hi>King</hi> in and over the Conſcience, as the Saints have teſtified in the Scriptures of Truth; and whoſoever would intrude, ſo as to be Judge and Lawgiver over the Conſcience, intrencheth upon the Perogative of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 22. <hi>James</hi> 4.12.</item>
                        <item>14. Becauſe, it is propheſied in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. <hi>The Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>15. Becauſe, to impoſe upon mens Conſciences for differences in Faith, is contrary to the Advice of the Apoſtle, who directs People <hi>to wait upon God to be ſatisfied,</hi> and not to the Magiſtrates, or others to be forced; who ſaith, <hi>Whereunto we have attained, let us walk; and wherein any man is otherwiſe minded God ſhall reveal, even that unto him.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>16. Becauſe, to force mens Conſciences, and to lay Yoaks upon them, is to make void the Bloodſhed and Sufferings of Chriſt, who fits upon the Throne of the Conſcience, and gives liberty there; and commands us to ſtand faſt in that liberty, and not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled

                        <item>17. Becauſe, in all Nations the different Profeſſions and Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, are either Friends or Enemies to the Governors; if Friends then obliged by that bond; if Enemies then Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is to take place, who ſaith, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> which if obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Perſecution for Conſcience will be avoided.</item>
                        <item>18. Becauſe Toleration of different Perſwaſions in Religion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, as not inconſiſtant with their Safety, and that in things contrary each to other, as the <hi>Sadduces, Phariſees, Eſaeans, Herodians,</hi> with others.</item>
                        <item>19. Becauſe, the true Religion cannot be preached up by force of ARMES, and the primitive Chriſtians deteſted that Form of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</item>
                        <item>20. Becauſe, no man hath ſuch power (by outward compulſion) over the Souls and Conſciences of other men, as to lay a neceſſity on them to believe that which they do not believe, or not to believe what they do believe; true Faith being the Gift of God.</item>
                        <item>21. Becauſe, If the Magiſtrate impoſeth upon the Conſcience, he muſt either do it as a Magiſtrate, or as a Chriſtian. Not as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, for then <hi>Heathens</hi> (being Magiſtrates) have the ſame power to impoſe; and ſo, by Revolutions and Conqueſts, may come to give Laws to Chriſtians, and compel them to Idolatry. 2. Not as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for that contradicts Chriſt's ſaying, <hi>The Kings of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exerciſe Lordſhip over them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you, for all ye are Erethren.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>22. Becauſe by the ſame Rule and Reaſon that the Magiſtrates of one Nation ought to impoſe upon, and perſecute for Conſcience, the Magiſtrates in all other Nations ought to do the ſame, and ſo the greateſt part of Mankind may come to be deſtroyed, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more that Diſſent, then are at Unity in Metters of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</item>
                        <item>23. Becauſe the ſtrength of Truth, and its Conqueſt over Falſity and Deceit is beſt diſcovered by letting both have their Liberty, from outward Compulſion; For no doubt, had outward Force been leſs uſed, the prevalency of Truth had been more manifeſt, and that wiſe Saying, truly experienced in the World, <hi>viz. That which is of God will ſtand, and that which is not will come to nothing.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>24. Becauſe. the Diſciples of Chriſt are rebuked by him for deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſtruction of thoſe that were contrary to him, and would not receive Him; which zeal is ſharply reproved in his Saying, <hi>They knew not what Spirit they were of.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>25. Becauſe, to impoſe upon mens Conſciences, and to deſtroy their Perſons for difference in Religion, is contrary to the end of Chriſt's coming, who, ſaith, <hi>He came not to Deſtroy mens Lives but to ſave them.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>26. Becauſe, People of divers Religions in one Nation, if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, muſt ſome of them be deſtroyed or removed, by baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If deſtroyed, the Conſtancy and Patience of the Sufferers for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39043:185"/>their Faith, moving Pity and Commiſeration, makes men more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to own, then to reject their Faith; and ſo rather multiplies, then leſſens the number of its Profeſſors; if baniſhed, this renders the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as ſo many Enemies abroad, ready upon all occaſions to diſturb the Peace and Tranquillity of their own native Country. There is therefore in order to the outward welfare of all Nations, a kind of neceſſity for a Toleration in them of all Religions.</item>
                        <item>27. Becauſe, to impoſe upon mens Conſciences begets a hatred againſt the Impoſers in thoſe who are impoſed upon, and forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to violate their Conſciences towards God, in matters of Worſhip.</item>
                        <item>28. Becauſe, men are commanded to be ſubject to the Powers that are, for Conſcience ſake, and therefore ſuch Powers ought not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute men for Conſcience ſake, being that is preſcribed for the Rule of Obedience, the Scriptures ſaying, <hi>Be ye ſubject not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi>

                     <p>IN the Kings Letter from <hi>Bredah,</hi> that was ſent to the Houſe of Peers, and read in the Houſe, <hi>May</hi> the firſt. 1660. and which Letter was ordered by the Lords in Parliament aſſembled, that it ſhould be forthwith printed and publiſhed for the ſervice of the Houſe, and ſatisfaction of the Kingdoms; it is ſaid in the Book of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of the Kings Speeches, Page 8, and 9. <hi>And becauſe the paſſion and uncharitableneſs of the times have produced ſeveral Opinions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by which men are engaged in Parties and Animoſities againſt each other; which when they ſhall hereafter unite in a freedom of Converſation, will be compoſed, or better underſtood. We do declare a liberty to tender Conſciences,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39043:186"/>and that no man ſhall be diſquieted or called in queſtion for differences in Opinion in matters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that we ſhall be ready to conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament, as upon Mature deliveration, ſhall be offered to us for the full granting that Indulgence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the Kings Declaration, concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which was dated <hi>October</hi> the 25th, 1660. it is ſaid, <hi>In a word we do again renew what we have formerly ſaid in our Declaration from</hi> Bredah, <hi>for the liberty of tender Conſciences, That no man ſhall be diſquieted, or called in queſtion for differences of Opinion in matters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom; and if any have been diſturbed in that kind, ſince our arival here, it hath not proceeded from any direction of ours.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>We do in the firſt place declare, Our Purpoſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is, and ſhall be, to promote the Power of Godlineſs, and to encourage the Exerciſe of Religion, both in publique and private.</hi> And in the ſame Declaration it is ſaid, <hi>Our preſent Conſideration &amp; work is, To gratifie the private Conſciences of thoſe who are grieved with the uſe of ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by indulging to, and diſpenſing with the omitting theſe Ceremonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Kings Speech to both houſes of Parliament, the 8th of July, 1661. <hi>It is to put my ſelf in mind, as well as you, That I ſo often (I think ſo often as I come to you) mention to you my Declaration from</hi> Bredah; <hi>And let me put you in mind of another Declaration, publiſhed by your ſelves about the ſame time, and which I am perſwaded made mine the more effectual; An Honeſt, Generous, and Chriſtian Declaration, ſigned by the moſt eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had been the moſt eminent Sufferers; in which you remounced all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Animoſities, &amp; memory of former Unkindneſſes. And my Lords &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, let it be in no mans power to charge me, or you, with the breach of our Words or Promiſes, which can never be a good Ingredient to our future ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the Chancellors Speech to both Houſes, <hi>May</hi> 8. 1661. It is ſaid, <hi>He told you, but now</hi> (meaning the King) <hi>that he valued himſelf much, upon keeping his word, upon performing all that he promiſeth to his People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And alſo in the Kings diſcourſe with <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he arrived in <hi>England,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Well, of this you may be aſſured, That you ſhall none of you ſuffer for your Opinions or Religion, ſo long as you live peaceably, and you have the Word of a King for it; and I alſo have given forth a Declaration to the ſame purpoſe, That none ſhall Wrong you, or Abuſe you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further in the Kings Declaration, dated <hi>December</hi> 26. 1662. wherein he declares, firſt, his wonderful Reſtoration without the leaſt blood ſhed by the <hi>Military Sword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he expreſſeth his Clemency, or the Clemency of his Nature.</p>
                     <p>And he vindicates himſelf from divers ſuggeſtions, of diſaffccted Perſons, particularly from that, of intending to ſubject Perſons and Eſtates to revenge or ſpoil, &amp;c. and from intending to introduce a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way of Government.</p>
                     <p>Alſo he expreſſes theſe words, <hi>as a malicius Scandal, viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That having made uſe of ſuch ſolemn Promiſes from <hi>Bredah,</hi> and in ſeveral Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſince, of eaſe and liberty to tender Conſciences, inſtead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming any part of them, we have added ſtreighter Fetters then ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:39043:187"/>
                     <p>And further adds, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>We find it as artificially, as maliciouſly divulged throughout the whole Kingdom, that at the ſame time we deny a fitting Liberty to thoſe other Sects of our Subjects, whoſe Conſciences will not allow them to conform to the Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, we are highly indulgent to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> even to ſuch a degree of countenance as may even endanger the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Religion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe, and ſuch like, in the ſaid Declaration are related as venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſinuations, moſt falſe and malicious Scandals, wicked and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Suggeſtions, and the Fomenters of them, as the moſt dangerous Enemies of his Crown and of the Peace &amp; Happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>neſs of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>And theſe words are further added, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
                        <q>It having been always a conſtant profeſſion of ours, That we do, and ſhall ever think our royal dignity and greatneſs much more happily and ſecurely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on our own Clemency, and our Subjects Loves, then in their Fears and our Power.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>To give our People a Teſtimony of our founding all our ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rather in their affections, then in any Military Power; the ſole ſtrength and ſecurity, we ſhall ever confide in, ſhall be the hearts and affections of our Subjects, indeared and confirmed to us by our Gratious and Steady manner of Government, according to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent known Laws of the Land, there being not any one of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who doth more from his heart abhor (then we our ſelves) all ſorts of Military and Arbitrary Rule.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the non-performance of our Promiſes; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well the very words of thoſe from <hi>Bredah, (viz.)</hi> We do declare a liberty to tender Conſciences, and that no man ſhall be diſquieted, or called in queſtion for differences of Opinion in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom; and that we ſhall be ready to conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament, as upon Mature deliberation ſhall be offered to us, for the full grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Indulgence. We remember well the Confirmations, we have made of them ſince upon ſeveral occaſions in Parliament; and as all there things are ſtill freſh in our memory, ſo are we ſtill firm in the Reſolution of performing them to the full.</p>
                        <p>We do conceive our ſelves ſo far engaged, both in honour, and in what we owe to the Peace of our Dominions, which we profeſs we can never think ſecure, whilſt there ſhall be a colour left to the diſaffected, to inflame the minds of ſo many Multitudes, upon the ſcores of Conſciences with diſpair of ever obtaining any effect of our Promiſes for their eaſe.</p>
                        <p>Such an <hi>Act,</hi> as in purſuance of our <hi>promiſes</hi> the wiſdom of our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ſhall think fit to offer unto us for the eaſe of <hi>tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We profeſs it would be <hi>grievous unto us</hi> to conſent, to the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our <hi>Subjects to death</hi> for their <hi>Opinions</hi> in matter of <hi>Religion</hi> only.</p>
                        <p>Our expreſſing according to Chriſtian Charity Our diſlike of Blood-ſhed for Religion only.</p>
                        <p>Our Parliament is an Aſſembly ſo eminent in their Loyalty and their Zeal, for the Peace and Proſperity of our Kingdoms — can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39043:187"/>no wayes be doubted in the performance of all our Promiſes, and to the effecting all thoſe gracious intentions, which God knows our heart is full of, for the PLENTY, PROSPERITY, and UNIVERSAL SATISFACTION of the NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.</p>
                        <p>We think to give them the moſt important Marks of our care Firſt, In puniſhing by ſevere Laws that Licentiouſneſs and Impiety, which we find to our great grief, hath overſpread the Nation.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly ſo to improve the good conſequence—to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of trade, that all our Subjects finding the advantage— in that Prime foundation of plenty, they may all, with minds hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily compoſed by our clemency and indulgence (inſtead of taking up thoughts of deſerting their profeſſions) apply themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and with redoubled induſtry to their ſeveral vocations, &amp;c.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Alſo in the Votes and Advice of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Febr.</hi> 5. 1662. Upon reading the Kings, Declaration and Speech, are theſe words, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
                        <q>And our hearts are further enlarged in theſe returns of Thanks-giving when we conſider your Majeſties moſt Princely; and Heroick profeſſions of relying upon the affections of your People, AND ABHORING ALL SORTS OF MILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARY AND ARBITRARY RULE, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in the Kings Declaration, <hi>March</hi> 15th 1671. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evident <hi>by the ſad Experience of twelve years,</hi> that there is very little fruit of all thoſe forceable courſes.</p>
                     <p>And in <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. Its ſaid, we do in the next place declare our will and pleaſure to be, that the Execution of all, and all manner of penal Laws in matters Eccleſiaſtical, againſt whatſoever ſort of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts or Recuſants, be immediately ſuſpended, and they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuſpended, &amp;c.</p>
